Ministers aim to raise cost-effectiveness thresholds for NHS drug approvals by about 25%. Negotiations involve business adviser Varun Chandra and follow global pricing pressures including US tariff threats under Donald Trump. Vallance highlighted new investments—Moderna (£150m), BioNTech (£1bn) and Convatec (£500m)—as part of ambitions to make the UK Europe’s leading life sciences hub by 2030.",

Investigators allege managers used fictitious goods contracts, sham loans and offshore affiliates—including a €137m CO2 certificate sale to Gazprom via Singapore—to divert investment funds. The probe, part of wider Romanian business raids, compounds Sanjeev Gupta’s troubles after the 2021 Greensill collapse, UK Serious Fraud Office scrutiny and the loss of key UK and Australian steelworks.

The facility would convert US shale gas ethane into ethylene, emitting particulate matter and unleashing 3.8m tonnes of CO2e annually when full lifecycle emissions are counted—five times Ineos’s estimate of 655,000 tonnes. Campaigners say this case, the first to press scope-3 emissions and plastics in court, could reshape Europe’s environmental impact assessments.",

China swiftly banned exports from all Nexperia sites, threatening production at global automakers—Nissan, Honda, Mercedes and VW have warned of shortages of its low-cost power-control chips used in airbags, locks and mirrors. EU and Chinese officials plan further talks while Brussels accelerates its Chips Act strategy. Nexperia says it hopes to resume shipments once payments are resolved.",

His stance mirrors BAT lobbying; tobacco firms have threatened legal action. He hadn't declared the link, calling the relative \"barely family\". He called cigars \"harmless\" and disclosed a separate tie: a minority investor in one of his firms makes vapes. He says peers rely on lobbyists and works with Action on World Health (co-founded by Nigel Farage), Free Speech Union and Big Brother Watch; he met an industry representative at the July British Grand Prix. BAT denies awareness and says a generational ban would fuel illicit trade. AWH denies bill talks. The Lords code requires declaring relevant interests.",

Lloyds is consulting; legal challenge not ruled out. Barclays lifted its provision to £325m (+£235m).",

The company says government was very supportive. DBT wouldn’t confirm council contact but backed the project and said Russia ties had ended. The plan faces local objections over traffic, water and environment. Labour’s Chris Bryant raised founders’ far-right links and Nicolas de Villiers’s 2014 praise of Putin and ties to sanctioned oligarch Malofeyev. The firm calls objections conspiracies, says it passed due diligence; a planning application was filed in August.",

Despite resilience from front-loading, supply-chain rejigs, partner capitulation and friendshoring, UNCTAD says global trade grew $500bn in H1 2025, led by developing nations. Yet tariffs are biting poorer countries; US credibility risks mount amid unfunded tax cuts and attacks on the Fed, imperiling Treasuries. An AI investment boom masks weakness; WTO says 20% of H1 goods-trade growth was AI-related, while BoE and Georgieva warn valuations resemble dot-com, risking a sharp, global correction.",

Lenders face c.£8.2bn compensation plus £2.8bn admin (~£11bn total). Payouts could start early next year, with statutory interest added (avg 2.09%). Over 4m have complained; lenders will contact them first. Others will be asked to opt in within six months; uncontacted consumers get a year to claim. Prior compensation excludes claims. Despite an August supreme court ruling narrowing liability, FCA proceeds.",

      "summary": "UK business confidence hit a record low in September, the Institute of Directors said, as cost expectations rose to new highs, led by surging employment costs; energy prices also weighed. IoD’s Anna Leach urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to deliver a growth-focused November budget underpinned by fiscal credibility. At the Bank of England, Clare Lombardelli and Catherine Mann warned inflation may prove persistent—exacerbated by food prices—into 2026; both opposed August’s rate cut, unlike the MPC majority expecting inflation to fall to 2% next year from a likely 4% September peak. Reeves touted five rate cuts this year, but sticky inflation could curb further easing and her fiscal headroom. MPC’s Sarah Breeden struck a more dovish note, seeing a temporary “hump.”",

They seek a monetary-policy review for climate shocks, tolerance of temporarily higher inflation, and buffer stocks of staples. They argue rate hikes raise decarbonisation costs, noting the UK’s inflation was fueled by fossil spikes. The BoE cut rates 25bp to 4%, says climate risk is in remit, and warns on weather-hit food. Campaigners want climate-weighted bank capital rules and discounts on fossil collateral. Carney, now Canada’s PM, has axed carbon tax and backs gas.",

The halt erased a promised 2,700 jobs and a ‘food school’, in a borough of 220,000 ranked fifth-worst for deprivation. The Corporation, which collects £1.3bn in business rates, formed a regeneration team and says the site could host other uses, but offers no timeline. Wider uncertainty looms: Ford’s 450-acre plant still builds about 1m diesel engines as the technology winds down; Beam Park rail station was shelved; Thames Freeport is drafting a masterplan. One bright spot: Eastbrook Studios opened, touting up to 5,000 jobs.",

      "summary": "Ruth Curtice, ex-Treasury fiscal chief now leading the Resolution Foundation, urges chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost fiscal credibility in November’s budget by widening the £9.9bn headroom—even if that means breaking Labour’s tax pledges and considering broad-based tax rises. She rejects a new wealth tax, backing capital gains tax alignment with income tax and better inheritance tax. Curtice calls to scrap the pensions triple lock for earnings uprating, and to lift the two-child benefits cap (£3.5bn/year) to curb surging child poverty—projected to hit records, with half of large-family children in poverty. She warns of broad living-standards stagnation (pensioners +21% vs non‑pensioners +7%).",

      "summary": "A US‑UK pact to mutually recognise nuclear safety regimes could cut licensing to two years (from 3–4), tackling nuclear’s biggest delay. Centrica signed a development deal with US‑based X‑energy to build up to 12 80MW advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool by the mid‑2030s—the UK’s first AMR push—alongside three 470MW Rolls‑Royce SMRs and a privately funded off‑grid “micro” plant at London Gateway port. Yet economics loom: no SMR has been built; mega‑plants remain costly. Sizewell C, a Hinkley C replica, is priced at £38bn, with customers paying before completion; Cornwall Insight says non‑exempt large users face £200k+ a year. Britain Remade notes France/Finland deliver similar designs at about half the price; South Korea at ~one‑sixth. A taskforce blames outdated regulation and risk aversion. Costs still dominate, but 2025 may prove pivotal.",
