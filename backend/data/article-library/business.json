Estimating a total economic hit of £85 bn annually, the report calls for a tripartite partnership between firms, employees and the NHS to cut sickness absences, improve return-to-work rates and boost disability employment. It forecasts up to £18 bn in benefits if fully implemented. Over 60 organisations—including British Airways, Nando’s and Tesco—will pilot certified, NHS-integrated workplace-health schemes costing about £5–15 per employee per month, and Mayfield suggests tax rebates and incentives for employer sick-pay investment.",

Nationwide forecasts modest affordability gains if incomes outpace prices and borrowing costs ease.",

Senior executive Hiroyuki Ueda told reporters no explicit commitment at that scale was made, though Toyota plans to maintain investment and US job creation levels similar to its first term spending (around $10bn). Ueda noted talks with officials preceded Trump’s remarks and the chairman did not discuss new funding. The disclosure came as Trump and Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, signed rare-earths and trade deals.",

The Eurofighter deal secures about 500 jobs at BAE Systems’ Lancashire plants and benefits European partners, with deliveries from 2030. Critics, including Amnesty International, warn the UK has overlooked President Erdoğan’s human rights abuses as jailed opposition leader Ekrem İmamoğlu faces fresh espionage charges, amid a broader crackdown on dissent and threats to civil liberties such as same-sex marriage.

He warned higher levies, floated to help plug a £30bn fiscal gap—including mooted taxes on banks, property and landlords—would deter long‑term capital and hurt growth. NatWest, fully privatised this year, lifted 2025 income guidance to £16.3bn (ex‑notables); shares rose 2.9%. Thwaite echoed Lloyds’ Charlie Nunn, opposing an IPPR‑backed banking windfall tax tied to QE gains, citing UK competitiveness and banks’ role in funding mortgages and businesses.",

JLR shut IT across factories and offices, managed only a limited restart in early October, and doesn’t expect full production until January. The outage cascaded through its supply chain, affecting up to 5,000 organisations; smaller suppliers laid off thousands amid cashflow crunches. JLR, owned by Tata, was losing ~£50m a week; the UK offered a £1.5bn loan guarantee and JLR prepaid for parts to support suppliers. CMC rated it a category-3 systemic event. JLR’s three UK plants make ~1,000 cars/day; dealers were also disrupted.",

Proposal: a A$1.2bn strategic reserve with a taxpayer‑backed price floor and access for US/EU investors; Washington may take equity in Australian projects. Goals: secure AUKUS and cushion Trump tariffs. Risks: 90% of Australia’s lithium exports go to China (forecast A$8.2bn by 2030). Domestic processing is thin; a 10% processing tax credit starts July 2027. MAGA’s home‑jobs focus may block US backing for Australian downstream.",

Government bond markets are on shakier footing as issuance rises and reliance shifts to price‑sensitive buyers; stress is a tail risk but would be broadly disruptive given bonds’ benchmark/collateral role. The IMF flags tighter bank–NBFI linkages, urges stronger NBFI oversight and full Basel III adoption (delayed in the US/UK), and defends central‑bank independence; G4 safe‑asset status rests on institutional trust.",

      "summary": "Nils Pratley says Peter Kyle’s “decisive action” claim over an 80% UK Export Finance guarantee on JLR’s £1.5bn five-year bank loan is spin: JLR’s liquidity (~£5bn), £2.5bn FY profits and Tata backing mean access to cash wasn’t the problem. The real crunch is suppliers’ cashflow after August’s cyber-attack; relief hinges on how quickly JLR advances payments and money cascades down tiers. He urges direct SME support—British Business Bank loans, HMRC payroll-tax deferrals, and bank forbearance—potentially tied to higher UK battery content. Either let JLR handle it or aid suppliers; the guarantee raised false hopes and looks like conference window-dressing.",

A PIIE study deems CPI methodology robust but urges updates: fresher weights, alternative data, and subgroup indexes. Alternative gauges show mixed signals: BLS annualized 2.9%; Truflation 2% (down from 3% YTD start); Zillow rent 2.44%; Adobe online prices -3% YoY; Bloomberg Commodity Index +3.6% YTD. Yet ISM prices for manufacturing and services are up >15% YTD, and NFIB’s net price raisers at 21% (above 13% average). Author infers near-term inflation uptick, citing tariffs. Piece argues alternative datasets offer a more impartial read than federal figures.",

      "summary": "UK retail sales rose 0.5% month on month in August, beating 0.4% forecasts, as heatwaves, the August bank holiday, and back-to-school demand lifted spending, ONS said. July growth was revised to 0.5%. Clothing sales rose 1.3%; non-food stores gained 1.1%; food stores rose 0.5% as specialists rebounded; non-store (online) also increased. Despite August’s uptick, sales fell 0.1% over the three months to August versus the prior quarter, driven by weakness in non-food (antiques, auction houses, tech) and lower fuel sales. Retailers fear a 26 Nov budget with possible tax rises could hit Christmas; BRC says food and drink spend reflects higher prices, not volumes.",
