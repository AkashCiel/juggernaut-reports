      "summary": "Despite US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, rising rouble and potential Venezuelan output, Russia’s oil revenues have fallen from 50% to 25% of state income without triggering collapse. Putin has rewired the economy through a ‘medically induced coma’ of low growth (IMF forecasts ~0.6–1%), high interest rates (~20%), modest deficits (~3.5% of GDP) and low debt (~20%), funded by higher household and business taxes. Alternative buyers (China, India) and domestic reserves bolster war spending. Tougher EU insurance restrictions could bite, but no imminent economic breakdown—Europe must tighten sanctions and bolster Ukraine militarily.",

CEO Michael O’Leary, who branded travel agents as “pirates,” has vowed to appeal the “legally flawed” ruling. Although agency sales dipped, Ryanair still climbed to a record €31bn valuation, second only to Delta.",

New Ofcom rules, voluntarily adopted from October, bar sugary puddings, sweets and many “less healthy” products, prompting brands to pivot to fruit, veg and brand-only storytelling. Complex nutrient profiling and 13 banned categories—with odd exceptions for bacon or pastries—make compliance a creative challenge. Critics warn heavy reformulation and caveats undermine the childhood obesity goal, while food groups shift spend to outdoor and brand-only pre-watershed campaigns.",

His recommendations, accepted by Starmer, include clearer ministerial risk tolerances, upfront biodiversity payments and extending the approach to rail, reservoirs and wider industrial policy.

Meanwhile, Trump is eyeing NEC director Kevin Hassett as Powell’s potential successor, favoring deeper cuts to spur growth without stoking prices.",

      "summary": "Taylor Wimpey CEO Jennie Daly has called on the UK government to revive stamp duty relief or reintroduce a help-to-buy equity loan to lure first-time buyers and counter a cooled market shadowed by budget uncertainty. She argues a 75–80% LTV government-backed loan plus lower rates, alongside a 5–6% builder discount, could boost demand and help meet the 1.5m homes target. Daly warns build-cost inflation (up 20%) and piling green regulations—heat pumps, solar mandates, higher efficiency—risk making new housing unviable in lower-price areas. The government plans no new help-to-buy scheme.",

Menulog plans a voluntary four-week payout for couriers with at least six months’ tenure and recent deliveries, calculated on average earnings. Closure follows pandemic-era industry shake-outs (Deliveroo in 2022, Voly) and leaves Uber Eats and DoorDash dominant; unused vouchers can be redeemed before shutdown.",

      "summary": "Rachel Reeves faces her first OBR verdict ahead of her November budget, with bond markets wielding more influence than official forecasts. Recent falling gilt yields, aided by US moves and her fiscal discipline rhetoric, have tempered borrowing costs. City investors insist on public spending cuts—especially to welfare—to signal budget toughness, warning tax hikes could cripple growth. But such a stance, critics argue, ignores Britain’s ageing, health-burdened population and the welfare state’s stabilising role. Welfare outlays remain flat as a share of GDP, with pension and health benefits driving most growth. Cutting benefits risks higher poverty and weaker domestic demand, undermining growth and long-term fiscal sustainability.",

Warning that late-November fiscal measures could impact Christmas trading, Weston also endorsed a strategic review—advised by Rothschild & Co and backed by the Weston family—of splitting budget retailer Primark from ABF’s food division. ABF reported a 26% slump in pre-tax profit to £1.4bn as sugar and agriculture costs rose, while Primark sales edged up 1%.",

Around 1,500 self-employed drivers staged a three-day refusal, prompting DPD to defer but not cancel the cuts. Within weeks it terminated contracts of eight supplier firms and drivers deemed “ringleaders,” citing gagging-clause breaches and threatening to keep deposits to cover replacement costs. Labour peer John Hendy KC condemned the “revenge” sackings and urged legal reform to shield drivers lacking union protection.",

      "summary": "Volkswagen warned its full-year operating profit guidance (2–3%) is under threat from a looming semiconductor shortage triggered by halted supplies of China-made chips from Nexperia. The German carmaker, which sold 6.6m vehicles in the first nine months of 2025 (+1.8% y/y), has used cost-cutting and launches of new EV models, such as the Skoda Elroq, to offset a slump in Chinese demand. However, US tariffs on key models (€5bn hit) and a €1.3bn operating loss—following a €4.7bn EV-strategy writedown at Porsche—have weakened results. CFO Arno Antlitz blamed politically driven export bans, while EU manufacturers brace for potential plant shutdowns amid dwindling chip and rare-earth supplies.",

Grocery costs climbed 3.1%, led by a 15% surge in coffee prices. The surprise spike dashes hopes of an October rate cut and likely delays further easing into 2026.",

Bloomsbury's shares jumped as much as 10% after a 20% revenue rise in its academic and professional arm—driven by an AI licensing deal—though its consumer division fell 20% without a new Sarah J.

The tunnel, east of Dartford, has planning consent and £590m for early works; Balfour Beatty holds a £1.2bn roads contract. Full funding awaits a partner to invest up to £2bn for tolling rights; ministers target a start before decade’s end. Critics warn HS2-style overspend, opaque approvals and habitat loss in north Kent/south Essex; supporters tout less M25 congestion, freight resilience. National Highways will develop and report costs; ministers decide scope and funding.",

CEO Georges Elhedery frames the move as doubling down on Hong Kong’s “super‑connector” role with mainland China amid a broader pivot to Asia after last year’s cost cuts and east/west split. Amid criticism over China property exposure, HSBC has pushed Hang Seng to clean up bad debts. To preserve capital, HSBC will halt share buybacks for three quarters, sending London shares down 5%. With chair Mark Tucker’s recent exit, investor pushback marks an early test for Elhedery.",

Borrowing Apr–Aug now £81.8bn (was £83.8bn); the current budget deficit ex-investment £60bn (was £62bn), still above the OBR’s £46.6bn forecast. Tax rises remain likely to plug a £20bn–£40bn gap amid an expected productivity downgrade. OBR’s second forecast arrives 20 Oct; revised public finances 21 Oct. Data quality concerns persist.",

Premier Peter Malinauskas said agencies noticed 000 call drops and alerted Optus, defying protocol.

Internal posts call it a ‘slap in the face.’ Ops chief Jayne Wall says more staff are needed to reset for 27 Dec.",

Qantas will retrofit a fourth toilet to the first three within about three years; new A321XLRs arriving from December will include four. The jets replace 737-800s (12J/162Y), and are touted for wider cabins, seats, more luggage space, and better fuel efficiency. Qantas is first in Asia-Pacific, fourth globally, to operate the type.",

At least three deaths are linked; an infant case is now considered unlikely to be contributed. Ministers Kristy McBain and Anika Wells condemned Optus; pressure mounts on the Albanese government for stiff penalties. CEO Stephen Rue halted network changes, promised an independent review, and noted two NSW cases near the SA border.",

      "summary": "Next warned the UK faces years of anaemic growth, blaming four drags: declining job opportunities, competitiveness-eroding regulation, unaffordable government spending and a rising tax burden. Shares fell up to 6% despite robust H1 to July: statutory pre-tax profit +18% to £509m on sales +10.3% to £3.3bn, and a £99m dividend (87p/share). The FTSE 100 retailer, which distributes Gap and Victoria’s Secret, benefited from warm weather and M&S cyber-attack disruption; vacancies are down 35% in two years while applications are up 76%. CEO Lord Simon Wolfson said AI will cut entry-level roles and criticised the Employment Rights Bill, warning it could curb flexible hours. Peel Hunt remained positive.",

      "summary": "The Bank of England kept Bank Rate at 4% (7-2 vote) and slowed quantitative tightening, cutting its annual gilt run-off target to £70bn from £100bn amid volatile yields and market-functioning risks. With fewer maturities, active gilt sales will rise to about £21bn (from £13bn), skewed toward shorter-dated paper. Inflation was 3.8% in August (vs 2% target); unemployment is at a four-year high; MPC estimates zero jobs growth, partly from last year’s £25bn NICs hike. Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor backed a 25bp cut. Policy diverges from the Fed’s 25bp cut. QT losses lift Treasury borrowing costs; Rachel Reeves urged DMO coordination; OBR flags fiscal-rule risks before 26 Nov; DB pension decline weakens long-dated demand.",

Stephen Miran—who argued last year to ban the White House–Fed “revolving door”—joined the Fed board while on unpaid leave as Trump’s CEA chair and immediately dissented for a 50bp cut. The Fed delivered 25bp to 4–4.25% and signaled more, citing upside inflation risks after August reacceleration and tariff uncertainty. Trump seeks to oust Governor Lisa Cook and will be able to pick Jerome Powell’s successor next year. Powell insists policy is data-driven and independence intact.",

      "summary": "Ruth Curtice, ex-Treasury fiscal chief now leading the Resolution Foundation, urges chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost fiscal credibility in November’s budget by widening the £9.9bn headroom—even if that means breaking Labour’s tax pledges and considering broad-based tax rises. She rejects a new wealth tax, backing capital gains tax alignment with income tax and better inheritance tax. Curtice calls to scrap the pensions triple lock for earnings uprating, and to lift the two-child benefits cap (£3.5bn/year) to curb surging child poverty—projected to hit records, with half of large-family children in poverty. She warns of broad living-standards stagnation (pensioners +21% vs non‑pensioners +7%).",

      "summary": "A US‑UK pact to mutually recognise nuclear safety regimes could cut licensing to two years (from 3–4), tackling nuclear’s biggest delay. Centrica signed a development deal with US‑based X‑energy to build up to 12 80MW advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool by the mid‑2030s—the UK’s first AMR push—alongside three 470MW Rolls‑Royce SMRs and a privately funded off‑grid “micro” plant at London Gateway port. Yet economics loom: no SMR has been built; mega‑plants remain costly. Sizewell C, a Hinkley C replica, is priced at £38bn, with customers paying before completion; Cornwall Insight says non‑exempt large users face £200k+ a year. Britain Remade notes France/Finland deliver similar designs at about half the price; South Korea at ~one‑sixth. A taskforce blames outdated regulation and risk aversion. Costs still dominate, but 2025 may prove pivotal.",
