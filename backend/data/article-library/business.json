No concerns were found in Italian chilled ready meals or own-label salads. The firms have until 3 November to propose remedies or face a phase-2 probe. RBC estimates chilled sauces are ~1% of the combined group’s £4bn revenue. Greencore (Britain’s biggest sandwich maker) and Bakkavor (pizzas, salads, snacks supplier to Tesco, M&S, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Asda) still target completion in early 2026; Greencore shares fell ~2%.",

Economists link it to Rachel Reeves's 2024 budget: April's employer NI rise to 15%, a lower NI threshold, and a higher living wage lifted hiring costs, pulling part-timers into NI and choking entry-level roles. Joe Nellis says costs, not AI, are to blame. Public-sector pay is elevated after 2024 awards, but Deutsche Bank's Sanjay Raja sees private pay settling near 3% next year. With a November budget looming, Indeed's Jack Kennedy flags weak employer confidence. ONS sees a bottoming; large firms coping despite US tariffs, SMEs reticent.",

A quarter think most entry‑level tasks can be automated; 39% have already reduced such roles via AI for research/admin/briefing. 76% expect tangible AI benefits within 12 months. 53% think benefits outweigh disruption, yet many feel lucky to have started pre‑AI. “Automation” appears ~7x more than “upskilling/retraining” in reports. UK jobless rate is 4.7%; economists downplay AI’s role. TUC: half of UK adults fear AI job impacts.",

Amid criticism over China property exposure, HSBC has pushed Hang Seng to clean up bad debts. To preserve capital, HSBC will halt share buybacks for three quarters, sending London shares down 5%. With chair Mark Tucker’s recent exit, investor pushback marks an early test for Elhedery.",

      "summary": "HMRC is conducting a scoping exercise into the tax residency and business affairs of George “Posh George” Cottrell, a Farage/Reform UK ally. Scrutiny covers a £4m west London home (90‑day residency tests), gambling-linked cashflows, and crypto activity via Tether.bet. Lawyers say he lives in Montenegro, is unaware of any probe, and has no crypto-company involvement. Records show the house is owned by a firm tied to another Reform backer, yet Cottrell uses the address. His mother gave Reform £750k. Cottrell runs Geostrategy.com and served eight months for wire fraud. HMRC says this is not a formal investigation. Article subject to a legal complaint.",

He said such levies will fuel inflation. The 794-pub group faces £60m extra annually from higher NICs and minimum wage.

It invites pilots, cabin crew, schedulers, and other airline workers to share firsthand experiences of job pressures, specifically: adherence to flight time regulations, unrealistic rosters, and reliance on commanders’ discretion to keep services running. The goal is to better understand how current scheduling and operational practices affect those who “keep the show on the road.” Submissions are via an online form; terms of service and privacy policy apply. Responses will help inform coverage of working conditions and regulation across commercial aviation.",

The 2012 capacity market pays for availability via 1‑ and 4‑year auctions, yet profits still hinge on rare runs. RWE’s Tom Glover likens gas to a “fire brigade,” favoring beefed‑up capacity payments. A Greenpeace‑commissioned report by ex‑official Adam Bell urges a strategic reserve for gas, claiming £5bn/yr savings; critics fear weaker signals for batteries and demand response.

It’s the first oral GLP‑1 filed with the FDA; decision due year‑end; US production has begun. The rebound follows a ~60% share slide, profit warnings and plans for 9,000 layoffs under new CEO Mike Doustdar. Rival Eli Lilly’s orforglipron (n=3,127) delivered 12.4% mean loss, 20%+ in 1/5, no fasting; analysts see $10–25bn peak vs Novo’s ~$5bn. Pills may be cheaper, widening access despite UK price hikes/NHS limits.",

Shares fell up to 6% despite robust H1 to July: statutory pre-tax profit +18% to £509m on sales +10.3% to £3.3bn, and a £99m dividend (87p/share). The FTSE 100 retailer, which distributes Gap and Victoria’s Secret, benefited from warm weather and M&S cyber-attack disruption; vacancies are down 35% in two years while applications are up 76%. CEO Lord Simon Wolfson said AI will cut entry-level roles and criticised the Employment Rights Bill, warning it could curb flexible hours. Peel Hunt remained positive.",

QT losses lift Treasury borrowing costs; Rachel Reeves urged DMO coordination; OBR flags fiscal-rule risks before 26 Nov; DB pension decline weakens long-dated demand.",

Curtice calls to scrap the pensions triple lock for earnings uprating, and to lift the two-child benefits cap (£3.5bn/year) to curb surging child poverty—projected to hit records, with half of large-family children in poverty. She warns of broad living-standards stagnation (pensioners +21% vs non‑pensioners +7%).",

      "summary": "A US‑UK pact to mutually recognise nuclear safety regimes could cut licensing to two years (from 3–4), tackling nuclear’s biggest delay. Centrica signed a development deal with US‑based X‑energy to build up to 12 80MW advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool by the mid‑2030s—the UK’s first AMR push—alongside three 470MW Rolls‑Royce SMRs and a privately funded off‑grid “micro” plant at London Gateway port. Yet economics loom: no SMR has been built; mega‑plants remain costly. Sizewell C, a Hinkley C replica, is priced at £38bn, with customers paying before completion; Cornwall Insight says non‑exempt large users face £200k+ a year. Britain Remade notes France/Finland deliver similar designs at about half the price; South Korea at ~one‑sixth. A taskforce blames outdated regulation and risk aversion. Costs still dominate, but 2025 may prove pivotal.",
