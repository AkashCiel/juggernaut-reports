      "summary": "Britain’s widespread fatigue among women often stems from unrecognised iron deficiency: one-third of women 19–49 have low ferritin, yet GPs frequently miss diagnosis by checking only haemoglobin. Symptoms—severe exhaustion, brain fog, hair loss, heavy periods—are dismissed as lifestyle or mental-health issues. Oral iron supplements help only some; many need costly IV infusions (£600/NHS) but face long waits. Experts cite medical misogyny, dietary shifts (non-heme vs heme iron), and lack of routine screening. Advocates urge ferritin tests for symptomatic women and streamlined infusion pathways to restore women’s health and productivity.",

      "summary": "Researchers have shown that seasonal affective disorder (SAD)—a winter-onset subtype of depression marked by low energy, hypersomnia and carb cravings—stems from endogenous shifts in circadian biology triggered by reduced daylight. Large-scale cohorts like the UK Biobank reveal seasonal gene expression changes and sleep pattern drift. Bright light therapy (10,000 lux for 20–30 minutes at dawn) and early outdoor exposure help reset the circadian clock by suppressing excess melatonin, while CBT for SAD reframes winter expectations. Simple measures—consistent sleep–wake times, morning sun, outdoor activity and cosy rituals—can mitigate the winter blues, but persistent symptoms warrant professional help.",

He cites reports of BAME foster children too fearful to leave home, white carers questioned in public over ethnically diverse placements, and African-Caribbean and Asian social workers facing their “most racist” working environments. Gallagher has urged children’s minister Josh MacAlister for urgent government guidance to tackle normalized discriminatory attitudes, protect unaccompanied asylum-seekers and prevent a hostile climate that could drive vulnerable youth toward radicalisation. A coalition of 150+ charities backs the call. The education department pledges new recruitment hubs, £500m early intervention funding and forthcoming reforms.",

A decade after the WHO labelled processed meat as carcinogenic like tobacco and asbestos, experts blame government inaction for 54,000 UK bowel cancer cases and £3 billion in NHS costs. In a letter to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, four IARC scientists and allies call for mandatory warnings on nitrite-packed meat and a phased elimination of nitrites. The WHO found each 50g daily processed meat raises colorectal cancer risk by 18%. The Food Standards Agency disputes conclusive links.",

A Guardian probe found at least 144,000 carers are repaying over £251m—sometimes up to £20,000—because tiny earnings breaches trigger full benefit clawback. He demands publication of Liz Sayce’s independent review and reform of the “cliff-edge” penalty. A Liberal Democrat amendment in the Lords seeks to halt repayments until reforms are enacted. Campaigners say the DWP’s administration failures have created “a national disgrace.”",

Dr Zigmond traces this to four decades of neoliberal policies; Dr Sloan cites Hunt’s imposition of a 2015 junior doctors’ weekend contract without ancillary support; Dr Watts notes past calls for systemic error management; and Dr Freeman warns that litigation, adversarial inquests and complaints procedures still deter open learning.",

Five possession orders have been issued (two repossessions) and 24 tenants left voluntarily. Internal documents reveal the scheme was planned before last year’s election. Tenants’ court challenges failed. The council says reclaiming these homes will house vulnerable families, and is disbanding Homes for Lambeth after a 2022 Kerslake review recommended bringing stock back in-house.",

      "summary": "David Enoch (1926–2025) was a pioneering psychiatrist and founding fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists who championed humane mental health care. Spurred by wartime service, he studied at St Thomas’ and the Maudsley, publishing Uncommon Psychiatric Syndromes (1967) on Capgras syndrome. As consultant at Shelton Hospital, he instituted “care in the community,” transforming asylums into training centres. He advised on reforms after Barbara Robb’s Sans Everything exposé. In Liverpool he built a leading department, taught with compassion, authored faith-informed works like Healing the Hurt Mind, and remained active until 2012. Survived by wife Anne, son Dafydd and grandchildren.",

Anti-feminist figures like Bae In-gyu and Lee Jun-seok have mobilised male resentment into politics, provoking women-led protests and Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment.
