Only £3m is set aside for a teacher training pilot, with no long-term funding for frontline support.

A BMJ Case Reports study described a fit man in his 50s who consumed eight cans daily (≈1,200mg caffeine), developed malignant hypertension (254/150mmHg) and suffered a stroke, resulting in permanent hand and foot numbness. After discontinuation, his blood pressure normalized and he no longer required antihypertensives. Researchers call for stricter regulation of energy drink marketing, targeted public health measures and clinician screening for consumption in young hypertensive or stroke patients.",

Robert Appleford argues it punishes hard-working, self-made families over ideological wealth-bashing, while Tom Holden warns wealthy homeowners lack gratitude compared to genuine privilege. Vicky Mills highlights the contrast with shared-ownership renters facing steep balancing charges and sees a £2,500 levy as modest.

Rising racism and stricter immigration rules are blamed, with steep drops from India (58%), the Philippines (68%), Nigeria (28%) and Ghana (9%). International staff departures from Britain are also rising. NHS experts warn the collapse will worsen understaffing, lengthen patient waiting times, and hamper care. Critics link government labour policies doubling the wait for indefinite leave to remain to anti-immigration politics. Despite the slump, total registrations hit a record 860,801.",

Staff cited excessive workloads for inexperienced doctors, poor supervision and a “keep‐your‐head‐down” culture. The trust has faced a string of criminal scandals—staff jailed for drug theft, unlawful sedation, sexual assaults and a pending murder investigation—and suffers chronic understaffing, leadership churn and recruitment challenges. Under CQC scrutiny and NHS recovery support, the trust has recruited 116 doctors, strengthened junior training and introduced protected learning time, but BMA demands an external probe.",

Prostate cancer is the UK’s most common male cancer (55,300 new cases and 12,200 deaths annually, 80% 10-year survival). Early stages often asymptomatic; detection relies on PSA screening, pre-biopsy MRI and transperineal biopsy pathways. Healthcare bodies like Cancer Research UK cite PSA’s false positives/negatives and overdiagnosis risks, while advocates argue MRI-first protocols mitigate harm. The UK National Screening Committee will review evidence alongside the £42m TRANSFORM trial due in 2027.",

Responding, NDMC head Dr Bongani Elias Sithole declared gender-based violence and femicide a national disaster after ruling it met Disaster Management Act criteria. President Ramaphosa and minister Velenkosini Hlabisa pledged dedicated resources, while Women For Change plans a detailed action-plan meeting next week.",

An RCGP survey shows 61% of practices need more doctors but 92% lack funding. Over 8,000 GPs have petitioned Health Secretary Wes Streeting for a detailed 10-year workforce plan with concrete recruitment targets.

      "summary": "The UK’s crime and policing bill amendment will make it a criminal offence to possess or publish porn featuring strangulation or suffocation in the UK. Anti-trafficking campaigner Samantha Browne, who was exploited from age 16 in the adult industry and now leads consent workshops, says the ban will stop young people normalising violent sex and pave the way to outlaw other abusive content. Research links sexual choking to brain injury even without loss of consciousness. Browne warns that ever-more extreme porn fuels desensitisation, erectile dysfunction and demand for hardcore acts, though critics question policing overseas material.",

This systemic exclusion undermines young people’s practical understanding of democracy, leaving them ill-prepared to appreciate its value if they never experience meaningful participation in school governance.",

      "summary": "A UK study led by King’s College London measured physiological responses of 50 adults (aged 18–40) viewing original Manet, Van Gogh and Gauguin art at the Courtauld Gallery versus reproductions outside a gallery. Gallery viewers saw cortisol levels drop by 22% (vs 8%), IL-6 and TNF-alpha fall by 30% and 28%, plus increased heart rate and skin-temperature dips. Findings show original art simultaneously modulates immune, endocrine and autonomic systems to reduce stress and boost wellbeing. Art Fund calls benefits universal, urging gallery visits.",

Jailed for 12 months in September for assaults on a woman and a 14-year-old, Kebatu—still in a grey prison-issue tracksuit and carrying a white avocado-patterned bag—has been spotted across London. Police have deployed specialist teams, appealed for public sightings and urged him to surrender as an investigation into the human error release proceeds. The Prison Service has launched an urgent investigation, while union leaders and the prime minister have condemned the blunder and demanded reforms.",

With an assisted dying bill now before the House of Lords, she urges legal reform to bring deaths into a regulated, transparent process and spare relatives needless distress.",

      "summary": "Analysis by the Institute for Government finds that, despite above-inflation funding rises totalling 4% in real terms this year and promised increases of over 1% above inflation annually, English councils’ real-term spending power in 2028-29 will still be nearly 15% below 2010 levels. Cuts from 2010–19 forced councils to slash youth centres by 60% and libraries by 50%, making statutory social care—now over two-thirds of budgets—their main focus. Many rely on emergency grants, with 40% facing insolvency without delayed special needs accounting. Birmingham alone is drawing on £80m reserves amid bin-strike costs and overspends.",

Awarded £300,000 in damages, the Sands now seek to hold Bond’s users accountable, freeze his assets and pressure networks to block the site, aiming to end its profit-from-misery model.",
