      "summary": "Kishwer Falkner, chair of the EHRC, outlines updated guidance for service providers to implement the Equality Act’s definition of sex following the Supreme Court’s ruling. Submitted to government after consultation with more than 50,000 organisations and individuals, the revised code offers practical examples and clarifies how businesses can balance user rights and avoid discrimination. Providers may need to adjust policies or reconfigure facilities as a proportionate solution. Falkner emphasizes that the EHRC advises on, but does not make, equality law, and that compliance will mitigate legal, financial and reputational risks.",

MPs, including John Glen and chair Meg Hillier, challenged her denial amid expert calls—from ex-Paddy Power founder Stewart Kenny and policy analysts Theo Bertram and Carsten Jung—to tax high-risk gambling more heavily while preserving lower rates for benign bets. Industry threats to close shops amplify pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her fiscal plans.",

Communities Secretary Steve Reed will write off a large chunk of Woking’s unsupported debt to facilitate the creation of West Surrey (Woking, Guildford, Runnymede, Spelthorne, Surrey Heath, Waverley) and East Surrey (Elmbridge, Epsom & Ewell, Mole Valley, Reigate & Banstead, Tandridge). The move, part of Labour’s devolution revolution and biggest local‐government shake-up since the 1970s, aims to drive efficiency savings, improve services and pave the way for more mayoral authorities, though further taxpayer support may be needed if asset sales fall short.",

Tobacco firms threaten legal action and have lobbied MPs to weaken provisions. Public opinion is divided: a Forest survey finds 58% support alternative bans while critics highlight industry ties delaying heated tobacco restrictions.",

Businesses cite fears of expensive litigation over balancing trans rights with women-only spaces, the expense of retrofitting gender-neutral facilities (one retailer estimated £1.2m for 200 stores), staff unease policing gender, and potential economic and reputational damage from excluding or deterring trans employees and visitors. Ministers will now review the code before laying it before parliament.",

GP-related settlements topped 2,914 cases in 2024-25, while 1,016 obstetric brain-injury suits cost £1.6bn. The NAO warns liabilities could reach £4.1bn annually by 2029-30 as total claims double to 13,329. Meanwhile, hospital estate repair costs jumped 16% to £15.9bn, prompting calls for urgent safety and infrastructure reforms.",

      "summary": "Scotland’s parliament passed a landmark housing bill granting ministers power to designate rent control zones where councils can cap rent increases at inflation plus one percentage point (max 6%). Touted as the UK’s first long-term rent controls and hailed by the Scottish Greens, the measure exempts mid-market, build-to-let and student housing, prompting tenants’ union Living Rent to warn of a “two-tier” system. The bill also enacts “Awaab’s law” for mandatory landlord repairs, stronger support for social tenants facing abuse, and uncapped taxes on second and empty homes. SNP minister Màiri McAllan lauds new homelessness-prevention duties, while Shelter Scotland and campaigners urge bolder action amid falling housing completions.",

      "summary": "Since 2022 private psychology fees in the UK have surged 34%, with 12-session packages now averaging £1,550 (up from £1,152) and per-session rates rising from £96 to £129.20. A survey of 349 practitioners shows 29% are at capacity and turning away new clients. Regional fees range from £164 in Leicester and £160 in London to £85 in Colchester, while waiting times span 16.9 days in Scotland to 23.8 in Wales. Record NHS mental-health backlogs (1.79m on community service waiting lists) drive one-third of patients private, prompting fears of a two-tier system as providers cope with cost-of-living pressures. NHS England plans to expand its talking-therapies workforce to reduce delays.",

      "summary": "Former NICE chief Andrew Dillon rebuts Polly Toynbee’s “special circle of hell” depiction of NHS drug pricing, urging stronger negotiation frameworks. He acknowledges that new medicines, always pricier than predecessors, deliver incremental or transformative patient benefits and are routinely endorsed through NICE’s cost-effectiveness assessments. Although its value threshold dates back 25 years, NICE often flexes it to approve promising treatments. Dillon pinpoints slow NHS uptake and government–pharma profit caps as added hurdles, and calls for three reforms: an independent review of the threshold; binding uptake targets; and early pharma engagement with realistic launch prices in exchange for preferential cap terms.",

Co-director Roger Wilkins attributes rising poverty over 10–15 years to Howard and Gillard policy changes that shifted predominantly mothers off parenting payments onto lower unemployment benefits. He warns of a “silent crisis” affecting 34.7% of children in these households, highlights the lack of an official poverty measure and calls 2023’s extension of generous parenting payments to age 14 insufficient.",

They warn 28 days is insufficient to secure rented housing, employment and benefits, risking thousands of new refugees rough sleeping this winter amid rising racist sentiment. The letter cautions increased homelessness will strain local authorities and inflame community tensions. The government defends its wider asylum reforms and backlog reduction efforts.",
