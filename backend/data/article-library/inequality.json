      "summary": "Economists warn that over $70 trillion in inherited wealth will transfer globally by 2035, exacerbating inequality unless G20 intervenes. The expert panel report, commissioned by South Africa’s President and chaired by Joseph Stiglitz, finds inequality rising in over 80% of countries, with high-inequality nations seven times likelier to face democratic decline. From 2000 to 2024, the top 1% captured 41% of new wealth; the bottom 50% just 1%. The commission urges a permanent G20 monitoring panel akin to the UN climate body to track wealth gaps and guide policy, bolstering social mobility and protecting democracy. President Cyril Ramaphosa calls inequality a betrayal of dignity and an impediment to growth.",

Trans, non-binary and gay workers and constituency caseworkers also earn less, with gaps widening over time. The report urges mandatory pay-gap reporting and structural reforms.",

      "summary": "New report by the Resolution Foundation using ONS 2020–22 data shows the typical UK worker would need 52 years of median full-time earnings to match the wealth of the top 10%, up from 38 years in 2006–08. The real wealth gap widened from £1m to £1.3m. Although the richest households’ share of total wealth has been stable since the 1980s even as overall wealth rose to 7.5× GDP, ‘passive’ gains from house prices and pensions since 2010 favoured older homeowners, doubling the gap between those in their early 30s and 60s from £135k to £310k. Regional divides persist (SE £290k vs NE £110k), and during the pandemic the lowest-income quintile saw liquid savings rise by just £80 versus £4,200 for the highest.",
