      "summary": "GMB union report, based on data from 174 Commons and Lords staff after the 2024 election, reveals that parliamentary employees with protected characteristics face annual pay gaps: people of colour earn on average £2,000 less than white colleagues; women £1,000 less; disabled staff £646 less; women of colour nearly £6,000 less than white men. Trans, non-binary and gay workers and constituency caseworkers also earn less, with gaps widening over time. The report urges mandatory pay-gap reporting and structural reforms.",

      "summary": "New report by the Resolution Foundation using ONS 2020–22 data shows the typical UK worker would need 52 years of median full-time earnings to match the wealth of the top 10%, up from 38 years in 2006–08. The real wealth gap widened from £1m to £1.3m. Although the richest households’ share of total wealth has been stable since the 1980s even as overall wealth rose to 7.5× GDP, ‘passive’ gains from house prices and pensions since 2010 favoured older homeowners, doubling the gap between those in their early 30s and 60s from £135k to £310k. Regional divides persist (SE £290k vs NE £110k), and during the pandemic the lowest-income quintile saw liquid savings rise by just £80 versus £4,200 for the highest.",
