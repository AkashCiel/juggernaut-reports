      "summary": "Inheriting more than $70 trn over the next decade will exacerbate global wealth inequality, warns a panel led by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz ahead of the G20 in Johannesburg. Commissioned by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the report finds 83% of countries—90% of the world’s population—face high inequality, which correlates with democratic decline. Between 2000–24, the top 1% captured 41% of new wealth versus 1% for the bottom 50%. It urges the G20 to establish a permanent inequality monitoring panel akin to the IPCC.",

Trans, non-binary and gay workers and constituency caseworkers also earn less, with gaps widening over time. The report urges mandatory pay-gap reporting and structural reforms.",

      "summary": "New report by the Resolution Foundation using ONS 2020–22 data shows the typical UK worker would need 52 years of median full-time earnings to match the wealth of the top 10%, up from 38 years in 2006–08. The real wealth gap widened from £1m to £1.3m. Although the richest households’ share of total wealth has been stable since the 1980s even as overall wealth rose to 7.5× GDP, ‘passive’ gains from house prices and pensions since 2010 favoured older homeowners, doubling the gap between those in their early 30s and 60s from £135k to £310k. Regional divides persist (SE £290k vs NE £110k), and during the pandemic the lowest-income quintile saw liquid savings rise by just £80 versus £4,200 for the highest.",
