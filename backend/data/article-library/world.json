After a briefing by defence intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko, Zelenskyy said Moscow shows no willingness to negotiate. Kyrylo Budanov, recently appointed head of the presidential office, has led Ukrainian negotiators to Washington to finalize security guarantees and economic recovery plans with US envoys including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, with hopes of signing a deal at the Davos forum. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Kharkiv, Sumy, Kyiv and Odesa regions have killed civilians and crippled power and heating facilities. To stabilize the grid, Ukraine is importing up to 50% of its electricity and receiving generators and solar panels from Lithuania.",

Italy’s antitrust authority had fined her €1 million and Balocco €420k over misleading claims that cake and egg sales funded a Turin children’s hospital—receipt limited to a €50k donation—while Ferragni later paid €1.2 m to settle the egg case. The scandal cost her 200k followers, major clients like Coca-Cola, spurred AGCOM influencer registration rules and ignited debate on ad transparency.",

      "summary": "Donald Trump urged Iranians to “keep protesting” and promised “help is on the way,” signaling possible military action over Tehran’s deadly crackdown on demonstrations. He cancelled talks with Iran, warned of “very strong action” if protesters are executed, and threatened 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran. The State Department ordered US citizens to leave. European diplomats doubt Iran will bend without a sustained bombing campaign. Trump’s stance, supported by allies like Senator Lindsey Graham, rejects nuclear talks and escalates economic and military pressure on the regime.",

Yet many Venezuelans view him as the regime’s true power.",

The species recovered from 51 individuals in 1995 to 236 today under a DOC programme, including 83 breeding-age females. When rimu fruit is abundant every two to four years, females can raise two to three chicks on the nutrient-rich berries. Males perform night-time lek booms audible up to 5 km to attract mates. This season sees many younger females but variable success; populations on three predator-free islands are nearing habitat capacity, posing a relocation challenge as numbers grow.",

Among those freed were former opposition candidate Enrique Márquez, activist Biagio Pilieri and five Spanish nationals including dual Spanish-Venezuelan lawyer Rocío San Miguel. Spain's foreign ministry confirmed embassy assistance for their repatriation. Opposition leader María Corina Machado hailed the move as a triumph over injustice. NGOs report only eight to ten releases so far, estimate 800–1,000 detentions remain, many at the El Helicoide torture complex. The government offered no official tally, sparking caution among activists.",

Riyadh says al-Zubaidi fled Aden by boat to Berbera in Somaliland, then flew via Mogadishu to Abu Dhabi under Emirati supervision. Saudi authorities expelled and charged him with treason, demanding international sanctions and blaming Abu Dhabi for stoking separatist ambitions. The episode deepens a rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE following last month’s STC push to secede southern Yemen—a drive that collapsed amid internal splits, a Saudi-backed counteroffensive across Hadramaut, Shabwa and Aden, and the UAE’s withdrawal of military support.",

Under US sanctions PDVSA's assets are frozen, blocking Venezuela's direct access to proceeds.",

Peace Now’s Yonatan Mizrachi warns accelerated planning could see construction start within a year. UK, France, Canada and other allies condemned it as illegal. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and PM Netanyahu back the plan to “bury” Palestinian statehood. Infrastructure funding was approved with Ma’ale Adumim in September; fast-tracked bids, permits and contracts could see bulldozers moving in before October elections.",

Joy turned to unease when President Trump declared a US-run interim government, sidelining opposition leaders and seizing Venezuela’s oil assets—stoking fears of accelerated deportations among the diaspora. Florida Republicans hailed history in the making, while Democrats like Rep. Maxwell Frost condemned the move as illegal and dangerous. Exiled entrepreneurs see an opportunity to help rebuild Venezuela, but many remain wary of Washington’s uncertain plans.",

AI algorithms like ‘Lavender’ scored civilians as militants, facilitating data-driven airstrikes with high civilian death tolls. Microsoft’s partial service suspension and employee protests highlight tech’s ethical and legal risks. These ties signal how future wars hinge on cloud AI, raising genocide liability and shaping global military AI arms races.",

With fears Israel may strike Hezbollah in Lebanon or Iran, they discussed preventing Tehran’s missile buildup and reinforcing Israel’s military edge. Trump falsely claimed full credit for hostage releases. The visit, Netanyahu’s fifth this year, aims to shore up US support ahead of Israeli elections and amid growing Middle East instability.",

Opposition parties remain suspended, top rivals detained or exiled, and critics warn of a climate of fear amid West Africa’s “coup belt.” Doumbouya’s government touts the new Simandou iron-ore mine as an economic boon, but doubts over democratic integrity persist.",

Parents received a €1,000 baby bonus and €370 monthly, but face childcare shortages and school closures. Nearby Sulmona’s maternity unit struggles to meet the 500-birth threshold for funding.

While customer data remains secure and in-store card payments, ATMs and authenticated online transfers via SMS function, users report last-minute parcel drop-offs blocked. No claim of responsibility has emerged, but the incident follows recent hacks on the interior ministry and private firms as France accuses Russia of hybrid cyber-warfare.

Industry groups propose vouchers, advance tariff checks, voluntary Korean-kimchi labeling, agricultural support and shelf-life R&D, while championing local quality and unique taste as the best defence.",

      "summary": "Beatriz Bernal’s 1545 novel Cristalián de España—the earliest known chivalric romance by a female Spanish author, bristling with dragons and sorcery—is relaunched for young readers in a richly illustrated adaptation by Diego Arboleda and Eugenia Ábalos. Bernal, largely forgotten after being eclipsed by Cervantes, originally published under anonymity; a posthumous edition in 1587 revealed her name. The retelling highlights her trailblazing female characters—Membrina, a self-determined sorceress, and Minerva, a knight who rescues others—reviving a genre that once legitimized women’s voices in 16th-century literature.",

      "summary": "Amid an early flu surge that has pushed the NHS into crisis, 55,000 resident doctors in England launched a five-day strike—their 14th since 2023—after last-ditch talks with ministers collapsed over real-terms pay erosion and a severe shortage of specialty training posts. Despite a 28.9% nominal pay rise over three years, inflation has left doctors worse off than in 2008/09, and just 10,000 training places exist for 40,000 applicants. Health secretary Wes Streeting’s offer to boost posts but defer raises was rejected by 83% of members. With ballots underway for a new mandate and independent mediation urged, the stalemate could extend into 2026, heightening risks for patients and the already overstretched service.",

The Foreign Office says it will study the judgment and decide next steps.",

The disaster carved gashes across nearly 4,000 ha of intact forest—already threatened by mining, palm oil and hydropower—and delivers an unprecedented “extinction‐level disturbance.” Scientists warn the species’ path to extinction has steepened and call for an immediate halt to habitat-damaging projects, rapid surveys, expanded protections and forest restoration.",

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen apologized for systemic discrimination; former PM Múte B. Egede called the practice ‘genocide’. Claimants, including Bula Larsen and Aviaja Fontain, hailed recognition of their trauma alongside monetary redress.",

In the US, the administration moved to revoke temporary protections for 6,100 Syrians, only to be blocked by a federal judge. Activists and researchers warn that forced returns risk retraumatizing refugees and straining Syria’s war-torn infrastructure—estimated to need $200 bn for reconstruction—while integration successes spotlight deepening mistrust and anxiety among the diaspora.",

Britain’s small training and embassy security contingent in Ukraine now faces renewed debate over potential ‘boots on the ground’ peacekeeping deployments. Separately, a Kyiv war museum memorial notes 40 volunteer Britons killed in Ukraine, none serving in UK forces.",

Key targets include recruiter Álvaro Andrés Quijano Becerra and his wife, plus fund managers Mateo Duque Botero and Mónica Muñoz Ucros. US-based firms linked to Duque moved millions in wire transfers, prompting calls to halt external military and financial support to the RSF. Hundreds of battle-hardened Colombians have trained child soldiers, piloted drones and joined frontline assaults. Analysts praise the measures, but experts warn sanctions alone can’t curb a Dubai-based mercenary economy. Colombia has ratified an anti-mercenary convention to strengthen security policy.",

Palestinians have been pushed into a narrow coastal enclave. Israel has built fortified outposts and declared the line lethal, shooting those who cross it. Zamir’s stance appears to contradict the ceasefire’s terms for phased Israeli withdrawal to an international force. Meanwhile, US documents envision splitting Gaza into an Israeli-controlled “green zone” for reconstruction and a devastated “red zone,” with true reunification deemed merely aspirational.",

Authorities extended polling hours, ran campaigns and offered incentives, yet boycotts remain one of the few safe dissent tools. Four people were arrested for incitement to spoil ballots; three face prosecutions. In parallel, mourning gatherings and calls for accountability over alleged building safety failures triggered a sweeping national security crackdown, with arrests of petitioners, activists and closure of memorial sites, raising fresh concerns about civil liberties under Beijing’s tightened control.",

Operations resumed at 10:40 GMT, though delays and cancellations persisted: EasyJet, British Airways, Ryanair, Delta and United flights were disrupted, including a diverted New York–Edinburgh service. Passengers waited up to two hours; some transatlantic and domestic connections were rerouted. A mother, “Felicity,” said she would miss her youngest child’s final nativity play. ANS engineers restored the system, blaming an unrelated technical glitch. Scotland’s busiest airport handles 43,000 passengers daily across 155 destinations.",

      "summary": "A cross-party group of 132 UK MPs, led by Labour’s Johanna Baxter, has urged Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty to ensure any US-brokered Ukraine peace plan explicitly protects forcibly deported Ukrainian children under the Geneva conventions. They warn the current 28-point framework omits special child safeguards and risks granting amnesty to alleged war criminals, including Vladimir Putin and Russia’s children’s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. MPs also caution that recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk would imperil 1.6 million Ukrainian children, erode their rights and hollow out the fourth Geneva convention, and call on the UK to insist on accountability and uphold international humanitarian law.",

Even as arrivals to Italy fell in 2024, 44% of central Mediterranean smugglers saw demand rise, 57% raised prices over heightened risks, and nearly half colluded with state officials. Just 6% of migrants said smugglers influenced their journeys, highlighting that shrinking legal pathways, not smuggler deception, fuel irregular migration.",

Instead, they redefine feminisation as the gendered reshaping of work: from heavy industry’s decline to service-sector growth and the assumption that women’s labour equals equality. This critical lens reveals how capitalism exploits gender norms, linking pay, hours and conditions to ideas of femininity and masculinity, and calls for nuanced descriptions as a step toward true workplace equity.",

They decry high living costs, unaffordable housing, overwhelmed healthcare and social welfare, underfunded research institutes, and governmental apathy on infrastructure, climate and indigenous rights. While many love Aotearoa’s landscapes and culture, they feel career progression, financial stability and personal growth lie overseas. The mass exodus, driven by necessity not adventure, leaves readers sad about abandoning the country they cherish.",

Over 115,000 infants missed six-month pentavalent and polio doses. Since 2024 the country lost 48% of its health budget under President Milei’s austerity, crippling outreach, clinic hours and school campaigns. Access barriers, economic crisis and rising post-pandemic vaccine mistrust compounded the decline. Experts warn of resurgent measles, polio, whooping cough and hepatitis A: whooping cough cases are three times higher in 2025, causing five child deaths so far.",

      "summary": "A revolt by 18 young MPs from Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative Junge Union threatens to derail a pension reform guaranteeing six years of pension rises, arguing it offloads €120bn of costs onto younger Germans. Led by 28-year-old Johannes Volkmann, grandson of Helmut Kohl, they could swell to 40–50 rebels. With Merz’s 12-seat majority in the 630-seat Bundestag at risk and a vote due in December, dissenters demand a 1-point cut in the 48% salary replacement rate, citing demographic pressures, rising contributions (19%), and polls showing eroding pension confidence. Merz has signaled sympathy but remains noncommittal.",

Costing roughly $200m/year, the relief aids hundreds of thousands in western Sydney. To fund it, the government proposes reinstating two-way tolls on state-owned routes, including the Harbour Bridge, Harbour Tunnel and the future Western Harbour Tunnel/M6 (due 2028). Opposition leader Mark Speakman brands this a broken promise. Negotiations to consolidate all tolling under NSW Motorways with Transurban continue, with a year-end update expected.",

UNRWA holds enough food, tents and essentials for 6,000 trucks outside Gaza and could feed the population for three months, yet faces a $200 million funding shortfall. Boucly urged the EU and US to press Israel to lift restrictions, ensure unfettered aid flows, resume cooperation with UNRWA and back a political settlement to prevent further trauma, orphaned children’s vulnerabilities and the risk of renewed violence.",

      "summary": "Wes Streeting, the UK health secretary, swiftly denied claims he was plotting a leadership challenge against PM Keir Starmer, quipping he’s a ‘faithful’. A late-night No 10 leak warning of ‘feral’ MPs spectacularly backfired, exposing internal paranoia and denting Starmer’s command of the narrative after the budget. Guardian deputy political editor Jessica Elgot argues the fiasco reflects Starmer’s struggle to define a clear vision, fueling renewed speculation around rivals including Streeting, Andy Burnham, Bridget Phillipson, Shabana Mahmood and Angela Rayner. Streeting’s on-air agility contrasts with an unclear policy agenda, intensifying questions over Labour’s unity.",

Arab states demand a stronger role for a Palestinian civilian police force, clearer mandate, consent requirements and funding guarantees from Gulf sponsors, while negotiations in New York risk delay and security vacuums.",

Ukrainian drone and missile strikes knocked out power in Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions, triggering major repair operations. President Zelenskyy praised King Charles’s role in reinforcing US support, detailed Ukraine’s energy recovery and warned of brutal conflict and heavy Russian losses around Pokrovsk.",

Social media posts and mass protests by parents highlight unsafe kitchens, poor storage and hygiene breaches.

Voter frustration with the previous PVV-led coalition’s dysfunction and the Netherlands’ fragmented proportional system fuelled D66’s rise from nine seats. Yet far-right parties collectively gained ground, and Jetten faces lengthy four-party coalition talks amid VVD reluctance to partner with leftists, tempering any notion of a broad progressive surge.",

He cites scenarios where unspecified ethnicity—for instance a “Brixton rapist” headline—leads readers to default to white suspects, thus fueling racist stereotypes and attributing crime to a supposed “criminal gene.” Forde urges a level playing field where every suspect’s ethnic background is uniformly disclosed to promote transparency and counter bias. He frames the issue as intersectional, linking selective disclosure to entrenched racism, socio-economic disadvantage and nebulous “British values” that exclude minority communities.",

In Istanbul, Muslim states—Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Jordan—debated troop commitments, deconfliction with Israel and the role of a technocratic Palestinian commission. Jordan will train a vetted Gaza police force, while Turkey remains cautious. Surging violence threatens the ceasefire, prompting calls for rapid force deployment, humanitarian coordination and a clear Hamas disarmament process.",

Delivery riders like Francisco Jiménez face rent crises, shop owners like Nicolás Pedrosa diversify to survive, informality climbs to 43.2 % and sectors from textiles to wine reel under a stark rich-poor divide.",

The IDF said it targeted weapons caches in Beit Lahia, while Gaza’s civil defense reported hits on displacement camps and a cancer patient camp. Hamas condemned the attacks as attempts to undermine the truce, vowed to uphold it, and delayed a hostage-remains handover. US officials insisted the ceasefire still holds despite “skirmishes.” Qatar is intensifying diplomacy to preserve the agreement. Domestically, far-right Israeli ministers demand renewed war even as Netanyahu reaffirms measured compliance.",

Fragmented results—with up to 16 parties winning seats—mean weeks of coalition talks. Main contenders include Wilders’ PVV (up to 25 seats), the GreenLeft/Labour alliance (26), D66 (23), CDA (22), VVD (18) and JA21 (14). Top voter concerns are immigration controls, housing shortages and cost-of-living pressures. Likely coalitions involve centrist and moderate right parties excluding Wilders.",

The findings, published in Current Biology, align with historical fever and diarrhea accounts and suggest that, alongside cold, hunger and combat losses, these unexpected infections exacerbated the 1812 Russian retreat’s lethal toll.",

The US targeted nearly 36 subsidiaries to choke oil revenues funding the Ukraine war, while the EU phases in an LNG embargo and blacklists two Chinese refiners. Early signs show India’s Reliance and China’s state firms pausing Russian crude imports. Moscow warns of price spikes and promises tough retaliation, even as analysts note Russia’s “shadow fleet��� could adapt to evade restrictions.",

In a letter to customs chief Florian Colas, they warned interceptions risk shipwrecks and deaths. The Home Office confirms France is reviewing its new “maritime doctrine,” while UK officials, including border security chief Martin Hewitt, express frustration at delays. Observers say the tactic may never be implemented, and a police union says it’s on hold. Meanwhile, the UK’s “one in, one out” repatriation already suffered setbacks after an Iranian asylum seeker returned by small boat.",

Each incident exposed security lapses—from hoax theories and guard shortages to failed alarms—and spurred major overhauls in surveillance, staffing and artifact protection.",

Displaced father of four Ismail Baba recalls dashed hopes from past ceasefires as civilians fear full-scale war’s return. Recent shelling killed 11 members of the Abu Shaaban family, including seven children, when their car strayed past a poorly marked withdrawal line. Despite ongoing violence and uncertainty over phase-two terms of the U.S.-drafted plan, Gazans cling to fragile optimism that a lasting truce could restore safety, aid and future reconstruction.",

Bolger later renounced neoliberalism as benefiting elites. Politicians across parties lauded his principles, determination and warmth. He served as ambassador to the US (1998–2002), declined a knighthood and was appointed to the Order of New Zealand.",

Speaking in London ahead of NATO’s defence ministers meeting, Sikorski backed US Tomahawk missile supplies to Ukraine, warning escalatory claims were overblown. He highlighted EU plans for a “drone wall” by 2027, NATO’s Eastern Sentry air policing and fresh UK sanctions on Russian oil firms as part of bolstering Europe’s eastern flank.",

Putin emphasised Moscow’s interests in Syria and friendly relations.

They suggest renaming the vestige the “windy city sidewalk squirrel.” The study, published in Biology Letters, highlights how wet concrete distortion and urban trace fossils challenge scientific interpretation.",

Experts and UN rapporteur stress migrants are victims, not cause, urging housing rights enforcement. Broader debates on limiting labour migration versus boosting construction, raising retirement age and reforming tax breaks continue.",

Israeli authorities say she will remain indefinitely detained unless she signs a waiver admitting to illegal blockade violation. Unlike other detainees deported after 72 hours, Habib refused. Australian consular visits noted harsh conditions—stale bread, brown water—suspected bedbugs but no physical abuse and nothing worse than hostels. DFAT officials, citing privacy at a Senate hearing, expect her release Sunday amid holiday shutdowns.",

The case collapsed weeks before trial when prosecutors could not obtain government confirmation that China posed a “threat to UK national security” under the 1911 Act. DPP Stephen Parkinson blamed No 10 for withholding evidence, revealing friction between the CPS and ministers reluctant to label China an enemy. Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Berry, a China-based analyst, deny passing more than open-source political gossip. The outcome raises questions about Britain’s espionage laws, the definition of “enemy” and UK-China policy.",

Egyptian FM Abdelaty says focus is a ceasefire, release of 47 hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and humanitarian aid via UN. Israel vows to crush Hamas; Hamas rejects foreign administration and arms surrender. Negotiators debate security forces, technocratic oversight by Trump/Blair, and prisoner-exchange details.",

LSE expert Dr Richard Martin warns that while Labour plans higher thresholds and parliamentary scrutiny, broad definitions of “serious disruption” risk uneven enforcement and leave protesters with limited grounds for judicial challenge. Critics note far-right rallies appear exempt.",

But with Tories polling in the mid-teens versus Reform’s 30%, depleted finances, eroded local structures and a hollowed-out membership, Sam Freedman warns the party risks terminal decline. Badenoch’s fundraising excuses and policy gaffes have failed to revive morale, while internal rivals like Robert Jenrick lurk. A centre-right reset could appeal to few constituencies, leaving the Conservatives trapped between two unbridgeable electorates.",

Challenges remain over logistics, long-term governance and Israeli PM Netanyahu’s insistence on retaining forces in Gaza.",

Trump threatens “all hell” if Hamas refuses. The plan swaps hostages for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, installs a Trump-led transitional authority and international force, and sees partial Israeli troop withdrawal. Hamas is split, its military chief opposes the deal, analysts doubt Israeli compliance. Meanwhile Gaza faces daily bombardments, mass displacement, humanitarian collapse and international criticism. Friday’s strikes killed 28 Palestinians amid ‘safe zones’ deemed deadly by the UN.",

The band denies any support for terrorist groups and plans legal action. Conservatives accused Gasparro of lying or ignorance. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has not responded. A UK magistrate recently dismissed a terror-related charge against member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh. Immigration lawyer Aidan Simardone warns that public allegations could prevent fair IRCC adjudication, leaving Kneecap’s Toronto and Vancouver tour in limbo.",

He credits this legacy with Israel’s 1948 founding and defense against Arab assaults. While Mazower warns the 1967 Six-Day War victory risked being Pyrrhic, Fisken asserts the Arab states’ Khartoum resolution—no peace, negotiation or recognition—proved the true disaster, damaging both Palestinians and Israelis.",

Yet Irish critics panned its ‘rudimentary’ colonial lens, anachronistic costumes, dim lighting, clumsy dialogue and caricatured Fenians. The Irish Times condemned its historical inaccuracies, the Irish Independent decried clichés and over-swearing, and social media mocked its ‘steampunk Mr Tayto’ hero and Halloween-style rebels.",

The Commission highlights cost mismatches in shooting missiles at low-cost drones. Meanwhile, a leaked proposal outlines a ���140bn interest-free loan to Ukraine, collateralized by frozen Russian central bank assets via Euroclear, using a legal workaround to bypass unanimity and Hungary’s veto. Germany’s chancellor Merz backs the plan ahead of an October summit.",

Judges stressed the ‘exceptional gravity’ of undermining citizens’ trust; his appeal will not suspend detention. Once a law‐and‐order champion, Sarkozy’s political legacy now seems irreparable. His downfall follows two prior graft convictions and parallels recent rulings against Marine Le Pen, reflecting an assertive French judiciary determined to hold current and former leaders accountable and deter future political corruption.",

      "summary": "Yale professor and fascism expert Jason Stanley argues the US is sliding toward authoritarianism—evident in the weaponisation of Charlie Kirk’s campus killing, widespread doxxing and firings of dissenters, and federal speech policing under Trump. He draws parallels to Kristallnacht and ICE militarisation, warning this global trend threatens democracies everywhere. Australia, with its White Australia policy legacy, harsh asylum seeker treatment and anti-woke politics, is especially vulnerable. Stanley stresses fascism disguises itself in democratic processes, that undoing it is ‘very, very hard’, and a US descent normalises ultranationalism worldwide.",

Danish police and experts note the craft’s green lights and multi-directional approach resemble Russian Gerbera or Shahed drones, which can reach Copenhagen from Kaliningrad or be launched at sea. The incident follows decoy-drone overflights in Poland and Estonia, prompting NATO’s Operation Eastern Sentry and extra fighter jets in Eastern Europe. With parallel ransomware attacks on European hubs, the pattern suggests Kremlin attempts to test and raise the cost of alliance air defenses.",

The study urges EU leaders to recognize this assault on Europe’s dignity, abandon appeasement, deploy the Digital Services Act and trade instruments, and fortify a shared European narrative against scripted crises.",

Barbers, librarians and technicians called for clear borders, arms embargos, sanctions, diplomatic breaks—citing decades of broken promises since 1948. Analysts and former negotiators warned that mere acknowledgement risks distraction without political will to end the occupation, halt West Bank settlements or relieve Gaza’s siege. Many compared international censure to South Africa’s apartheid sanctions as the only path to real change.",

Aligning with the island’s 100-year plan and following warnings of an extreme rainy season from Indonesia’s meteorology agency, the regulation, due by end-2025, aims to curb mass tourism-driven overdevelopment, mitigate flood risks worsened by climate change, deforestation and waste, and heed decades of environmentalists’ warnings.",

This will be the biggest demonstration since the 2023 protests against President Macron’s use of executive powers to raise the pension age to 64 without parliamentary vote. Citizens are being asked to share whether they’re taking part, why and how they view these strikes.",

      "summary": "China’s crackdown on its temple economy has escalated following high-profile scandals at major Buddhist institutions. In July the head abbot of Shaolin, Shi Yongxin, was stripped of his monkhood over alleged embezzlement, mistresses and illegitimate children – accusations he evaded in 2015. Similar probes ensnared monk Wu Bing for fraud involving donations, while viral footage of Lingyin Temple monks counting cash ignited public outrage. Under President Xi Jinping, the state is reversing prior support for temple commercialization, enforcing frugality and political obedience through new religious-affairs regulations. Temples must navigate booming tourism income against tighter party oversight to curb religious excesses.",
