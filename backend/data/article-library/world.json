Torrential rain, 13 ft storm surge and landslides swamped roads from Portland to Westmoreland, downing power lines and ripping roofs off buildings. Mandatory evacuations covered low-lying areas of the 2.8 million-strong population; three deaths have been confirmed locally. Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged ongoing relief amid warnings of slow recovery. Climate scientists attribute Melissa’s rapid intensification to record-warm oceans driven by the human-caused climate crisis.",

The findings, published in Current Biology, align with historical fever and diarrhea accounts and suggest that, alongside cold, hunger and combat losses, these unexpected infections exacerbated the 1812 Russian retreat’s lethal toll.",

In a letter to customs chief Florian Colas, they warned interceptions risk shipwrecks and deaths. The Home Office confirms France is reviewing its new “maritime doctrine,” while UK officials, including border security chief Martin Hewitt, express frustration at delays. Observers say the tactic may never be implemented, and a police union says it’s on hold. Meanwhile, the UK’s “one in, one out” repatriation already suffered setbacks after an Iranian asylum seeker returned by small boat.",

That gender-biased policy, common among mid-20th-century Antarctic explorers, effectively ended Cox’s career in polar botany. Despite this setback, Jenny Cox persevered, building a legacy of resilience and demonstrating how to forge new paths when institutional barriers arise.",

His forthcoming UN report urges a shift to universal, rights-based social protection as an investment in social cohesion. He cites studies linking higher inequality to populism and shows welfare boosts voting restraint and migrant net contributions.",

      "summary": "Veteran leftwing pro-EU leader Tufan Erhürman won a landslide victory with 62.8% over incumbent nationalist Ersin Tatar’s 35.8%, signaling a shift from Ankara-backed, isolationist policies. Campaigning on reviving UN-brokered reunification talks stalled since 2017, Erhürman promised confidence-building measures and a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation under EU norms. His win thrilled secular voters and younger Turkish settlers disillusioned by Turkey’s Islamist tilt, raising Greek Cypriot expectations for renewed negotiations. Analysts view this outcome as a potential breakthrough after decades of division post-1974 and a test of the south’s readiness to engage with a charismatic Turkish Cypriot leader committed to unity.",

Israeli PM Netanyahu vowed to retrieve all abductees as families, citing 28 bodies still held, plan a Tel Aviv protest. Hamas, citing technical challenges, deployed bulldozers in Khan Younis to locate remains and awaits Israeli approval for a Turkish recovery team. Disputes over dead hostages threaten progress under the US-mediated ceasefire, even as 20 living captives and 90 Palestinian bodies have been exchanged.",

Landini accused her of do-nothing diplomacy and being Trump’s lackey, prompting Meloni to post the dictionary definition of “courtesan” (“prostitute”), denounce his resentment and call out left hypocrisy on respecting women. Landini defended his choice as metaphorical, clarifying he meant she rode on Trump’s coattails. Meloni, who has fostered ties with Trump and faced past sexist attacks online, criticised opponents for lecturing on women’s respect then resorting to slurs.",

Rejecting 'return to austerity', she signals higher taxes on the wealthy within manifesto constraints, while the OBR’s downward productivity revision widens the fiscal gap, likely forcing cuts and new levies.

Bolger later renounced neoliberalism as benefiting elites. Politicians across parties lauded his principles, determination and warmth.

As the foreign population approaches 4 million (3.2% of 124 million), Abe-era policies opened doors to low-skilled workers to plug labor shortages. Yet rising anti-immigrant sentiment, fueled by right-wing Sanseito’s gains and LDP pledges to curb illegal migration and enforce integration, clashes with economic realities. Business leaders warn Japan needs migrant labor to avoid economic decline, projecting foreigners could exceed 10% of the population by 2040.",

Measurements of skull width, paw span and other features most closely matched the eastern grey squirrel, which is also more abundant locally than brown rats or muskrats. They suggest renaming the vestige the “windy city sidewalk squirrel.” The study, published in Biology Letters, highlights how wet concrete distortion and urban trace fossils challenge scientific interpretation.",

President Salva Kiir subsequently removed Machar, triggering the arrest of over 22 SPLM-IO affiliates and a cabinet reshuffle favoring Kiir’s allies. Analysts and opposition warn these moves violate the 2018 peace deal, risk reigniting ethnic-based Dinka–Nuer hostilities and full-scale war. This year’s clashes have already killed 2,000, displaced 300,000 and impeded aid, prompting UN warnings of collapse back into civil conflict.",

They view ministry as a representation before God, not aptitude-based. Labeling them bigots replaces debate with moral outrage. He warns that the Church of England suffers more from intolerance of theological difference than honest dissent. To preserve a broad church, conscience and disagreement must be protected. He urges the new archbishop to model unity marked by conviction and courtesy.",

The demographic shift has ignited political debate: right-wing parties demand stricter immigration and integration policies, even as business and experts push measures to support foreign families and social cohesion.",

While Karki’s interim cabinet promises to remove political obstruction and accelerate corruption investigations ahead of March elections, bureaucratic hurdles and resistance from major parties—who deem her administration illegitimate—threaten the movement’s goals and Nepal’s stability.",

She urged Brussels to adopt stronger measures against Kigali for backing the M23 rebel insurgency in eastern DRC, citing UN findings that Rwandan troops fight alongside M23 and commit human rights abuses, including forced child labour. Despite limited EU sanctions on individuals and a gold refiner, Wagner called the MoU “void of credibility” and warned ongoing violence has displaced 7.8 million people and killed over 1,000 this summer.",

Greenpeace-commissioned satellite images analysed by McKenzie Intelligence Services found no shelling craters, contradicting Russian claims of Ukrainian fire. The IAEA warns generators have fuel for only ten days. Observers say Moscow’s political aim is to force a safety crisis and justify integrating the site into the Russian grid, raising meltdown risks if cooling fails.",

Economic strains, from shortages to stalled exports, have deepened his reliance on Russia, yet he continues a tightrope strategy of hedging between Moscow and the West to preserve power.",

      "summary": "Canada’s federal government has designated the Indian Lawrence Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity, alleging its involvement in the 2023 murder of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar near Vancouver and a pattern of extortion, shootings and arson against diaspora communities. Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree said the move enables seizure of any domestic assets and stronger tools to counter the gang’s transnational network. The designation follows RCMP findings tying Bishnoi operatives to high-profile killings, including rapper Sidhu Moose Wala and politician Baba Siddique, and alleged collusion with Indian government agents. Rights groups and the World Sikh Organization have welcomed the step while urging accountability for all those orchestrating the violence.",

She urged Israel to shift away from its Gaza offensive toward an immediate ceasefire, restoration of humanitarian aid and the release of hostages. Cooper stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide, deferring to legal assessment, and highlighted a fragile yet growing consensus around a 21-point White House plan—including no mass displacement from Gaza, no role for Hamas and no West Bank annexation—and a proposed technocratic transition led by Tony Blair. She warned the process faces serious obstacles and stressed the need to harness fresh momentum to end the humanitarian crisis. Cooper also accused Vladimir Putin of deliberate provocations in Europe and called for stronger NATO sanctions on Russian oil and gas.",

Moscow’s “thousand cuts” infantry assaults have been routed, with Ukraine trapping forces at the Kazenyi Torets river and holding a 1,250 km front. Ukraine’s military intelligence accuses Russia of drone incursions into Poland to test NATO and erode Western support. In Brussels, EU ministers back a €140 bn loan to Kyiv and fast-track a drone-wall defence, while Belarus proposes a new nuclear plant to power occupied regions.",

Based in el-Arish before deploying inside Gaza with a UN-endorsed Arab force, Gita would act as supreme political and legal authority via a seven-person board, 25-member secretariat and five commissioners overseeing humanitarian, reconstruction, legal, security and PA coordination. The interim plan lacks a clear PA handover timeline, prompting Palestinian, Arab and UN criticism amid a competing New York declaration for faster transition.",

      "summary": "At the UN General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia’s integration of cheap drones and future AI marks “the most destructive arms race in human history.” He urged Western and non-Western powers—including China—to intervene now, arguing prevention is cheaper than building bunkers or rebuilding after wider conflict. Citing recent Russian drone incursions into Poland, he appealed for sustained support for Ukraine and neighboring Moldova against Kremlin influence. His dire warning stood in stark contrast to Donald Trump’s recent “paper tiger” assessment of Russia’s military, a shift Moscow dismissed as Zelenskyy’s influence following their UN meeting.",

Italy dispatched the multipurpose frigate Fasan—without orders to use force—to assist and proposed diverting aid to Cyprus and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Activists reported multiple drones dropping devices, jamming radios, and causing boat damage but no injuries. This marks the third assault this month, as Israel continues to bar the flotilla from reaching Gaza, accusing it of colluding with Hamas.",

Partnering with artist Cai Guo-Qiang and partly owned by Anta Group, the brand claimed use of biodegradable pyrotechnics, wildlife relocation measures and compliance with Olympic-level pollution standards. Critics accused the $800-jacket retailer of betraying its eco-ethos, urging boycotts. Arc’teryx and Cai issued apologies, pledging humility and cleanup; local officials noted prior approvals and no visible damage, though Shigatse authorities and the China Advertising Association have launched investigations into the marketing’s environmental and ethical impact.",

Anne Dobbing, a Catholic, decries the racist distortion of Christianity’s justice, peace, reconciliation and compassion, and urges bishops to publicly challenge the weaponisation of the cross. Rev Dr Jonathan Hustler highlights churches’ practical witness—welcoming asylum seekers, anti-racism training, warm spaces, food banks and policy advocacy—as the true enactment of Christ’s message. Andrew Copson argues that all people of goodwill, religious or not, should unite around shared values of freedom, justice and human rights, rather than debating theological ‘truths’ that deepen divisions.",

Macron’s third premier in 12 months, Lecornu inherits a hung parliament from June snap elections, a €44 bn budget hole, EU deficit breaches and a recent Fitch downgrade. Under police deployment of 80,000 officers, he must win over Socialists, centrists and even far-right to avoid a no-confidence vote and prove his “profound break” from past policies.",

Similar probes ensnared monk Wu Bing for fraud involving donations, while viral footage of Lingyin Temple monks counting cash ignited public outrage. Under President Xi Jinping, the state is reversing prior support for temple commercialization, enforcing frugality and political obedience through new religious-affairs regulations. Temples must navigate booming tourism income against tighter party oversight to curb religious excesses.",
