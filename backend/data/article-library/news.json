      "summary": "Researchers from Basel University uncovered ninth-century BC children’s skulls arranged in circles at vulnerable Bronze Age lake settlements in modern Germany and Switzerland. As flooding worsened, villagers added log palisades, stilt houses and stone-reinforced flood walls. Skull rings, redeposited years after burial, likely functioned as apotropaic magic—symbolic barriers to appease water deities. These circles appear near the final occupation phase, suggesting a last-ditch effort against rising waters. Though speculative and undocumented, the ritual highlights ancient communities’ environmental responses.",

      "summary": "More than 24 hours after a fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court, an eight-tower residential complex in Tai Po, Hong Kong, flames still raged in seven of the 31-storey blocks, sending acrid smoke across the district. Investigators suspect gross negligence—unsafe bamboo scaffolding and foam insulation used in long-delayed renovations—contributed to the blaze’s rapid spread. At least 65 people, including a firefighter, have died; dozens are injured, roughly 55 rescued and over 250 missing. Neighbours and volunteers have rallied at shelters, providing essentials and emotional support. Three construction workers were arrested, and the ICAC has launched a taskforce amid public anger over lax safety standards.",

Herder-farmer clashes, fueled by climate change, criminal exploitation and desertification, have seen armed Fulani herders expand south. Centralised Abuja control, lack of state police and poor intelligence create ungoverned spaces for Boko Haram and bandits. Chronic data gaps obscure true scale. Ignoring minorities remains Nigeria’s original sin. Global spotlight (Trump’s invasion threat, Nicki Minaj’s UN address) hasn’t addressed these root causes.",

      "summary": "At a parliamentary hearing, Commonwealth Bank Australia CEO Mat Comyn rejected ASIC’s finding that CBA and Bankwest charged $270m in ‘excessive fees’ to 2.2m low-income customers over five years, arguing the charges complied with terms and conditions and that full reimbursement would constitute appropriation of shareholder funds. He offered limited goodwill gestures. The stance contrasts with Westpac’s pledge to refund nearly $10m. Consumer group Choice criticised Comyn for defending fees that should never have left customers’ accounts.",

      "summary": "According to medieval and contemporary folklore, St Martin’s Day on November 11 offers a weather glimpse via goose behavior: mud on Martinmas signals snowy or icy Christmas, while ice under geese foretells a muddy festive season. The tradition stems from 4th-century French Saint Martin, betrayed by honking geese when he hid in their pen. Martinmas feasts slay these geese—allegedly the saint’s revenge—and preserve their wishbones for winter divination. Johannes Hartlieb (1455) noted wagers and Teutonic knights relied on goose-bone forecasts. Modern meteorologists, however, remain cautious without saintly sanction.",

Since the 2010s meteorologists have identified these events—periods under three weeks during which soil moisture in the top 40 cm plunges rapidly—based on Prof. Jason Otkin’s 2018 formal definition, later refined statistically. Triggered by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity, they cause vegetation stress, crop failures, heightened wildfire risk and sudden water shortages. Often precursors to prolonged dry spells, flash droughts also abruptly reduce water available for human consumption and agriculture.

Also: Rightwing America’s new ‘consequence culture’ on free speech, dodo de-extinction via gene editing, AI pioneer Song-Chun Zhu’s move to China, Simon Jenkins on Britain’s Trump visit and Marie Antoinette’s fashion comeback.",
