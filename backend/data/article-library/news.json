Yet ancient city-states also invoked him as a saviour: in 480 BC an oracle-led prayer summoned a three-day northerly storm that annihilated the Persian fleet off Athens, earning Boreas a temple and the annual Boreasmus festival. He later protected Megalopolis from Spartan attack and destroyed a Syracusan armada menacing Thuria, which built him a temple and granted him citizen rights. His capricious gusts embodied both peril and protection.",

      "summary": "Nigerian Modernism at Tate Modern (to May 10) foregrounds how artists from indirect colonial rule to post-1960 independence negotiated Nigeria’s identity. Curated by Osei Bonsu and Bilal Akkouche, it reclaims modern art from “traditional” framing through works like Aina Onabolu’s 1922 portrait of Charlotte Obasa, Akinola Lasekan’s everyday and mythological scenes, and Jonathan Adagogo Green’s post-1897 photographs of Oba Ovonramwen. Highlights include Olowe of Ise’s carved door panel reversing colonial power, Ben Enwonwu’s Negritude and Storm Over Biafra, Zaria Art Society’s decolonizing pedagogy, plus Ladi Kwali pottery, El-Anatsui reliefs and adire textiles. Acquisition challenges, restorations with MOWAA, and touring plans underscore the show’s multinational, diasporic narrative.",

Since the 2010s meteorologists have identified these events—periods under three weeks during which soil moisture in the top 40 cm plunges rapidly—based on Prof. Jason Otkin’s 2018 formal definition, later refined statistically. Triggered by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity, they cause vegetation stress, crop failures, heightened wildfire risk and sudden water shortages. Often precursors to prolonged dry spells, flash droughts also abruptly reduce water available for human consumption and agriculture. Addressing them requires enhanced forecasting, early warning systems, efficient irrigation and improved water management.",

Face-scanning checks were slower for these groups, and document-based age verification failed for 50% of Indigenous participants in a small sample. The official report downplays demographic disparities, excluding underperforming vendors and undisclosed lab data. High error rates (25–73%) for teens under 16 mean many 16–19-year-olds will need extra checks, while adults face minimal inconvenience.",

      "summary": "After the UK’s warmest recorded summer triggered signs of autumn weeks early, hawthorn berries and blackthorn sloes ripened in hedgerows from early August. While foragers might welcome the bumper crop, key winter visitors such as redwings (arriving mid-October from Iceland and Scandinavia) and East European fieldfares rely on a steady autumn supply of fruits to fuel them through winter. This premature peak could leave migrating thrushes facing food shortages, illustrating how shifting seasonal patterns from climate warming are disrupting UK ecosystems and bird migration timing.",
