Iconic Gurney’s Mount Baptist church lost its roof yet preserved its 1838 freedom stone. At COP30, Jamaican economist Mariama Williams and the Global Afrodescendant Climate Justice Collaborative highlighted how colonialism and enslavement created these vulnerabilities, urging reparatory justice, debt relief and sustained climate funding beyond insurance payouts. Caribbean academics and CARICOM’s Reparations Commission argued climate justice is inseparable from historical reparations.",

By 1860, George Symons founded the British Rainfall Organisation to collate hundreds of gauges nationwide.

Low-lying communities face trauma, lost livelihoods and mental-health strains while climate-driven ocean warming is blamed for the hurricane's intensity. Caribbean leaders demand reparations from high-emitting nations to fund reconstruction, a move backed by the diaspora's concert drives and celebrity campaigns. Urgent efforts to future-proof islands intensify ahead of next hurricane season.",

      "summary": "Boreas, the winged god of the north wind in Greek myth, was famed for his icy blasts that heralded winter and could wreck heroes like Odysseus and Hercules. Yet ancient city-states also invoked him as a saviour: in 480 BC an oracle-led prayer summoned a three-day northerly storm that annihilated the Persian fleet off Athens, earning Boreas a temple and the annual Boreasmus festival. He later protected Megalopolis from Spartan attack and destroyed a Syracusan armada menacing Thuria, which built him a temple and granted him citizen rights. His capricious gusts embodied both peril and protection.",

Gray’s uncritical portrayal of the brothers’ denials, his “Hustlers University” platform, and claims of a $50m payoff or “deep state” plot is contested. The Spectator maintains it upholds accuracy and reader judgment.",
