      "summary": "Astrophysicist Prof Tomonori Totani analyzed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope data and identified a spherical gamma-ray excess at the Milky Way’s center matching predicted dark matter halos. If confirmed as annihilating weakly interacting massive particles roughly 500 times proton mass, this would be the first direct evidence of dark matter since its 1930s proposal. The findings, detailed in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, require ruling out alternative astrophysical sources and replicating the spectrum in dwarf galaxies. Independent experts caution that extraordinary claims demand further validation.",

      "summary": "Just over 500 Myr ago, the Cambrian explosion saw emergence of diverse multicellular animals like Opabinia and Wiwaxia. A new study in Geophysical Research Letters uses a coupled climate–biogeochemical model to show that 2–3 Myr orbital cycles altered solar insolation, triggering high-latitude weathering pulses that flushed nutrients into oceans. This nutrient influx boosted marine photosynthesis, driving oxygen level oscillations that align with Cambrian oxygen records. Only during the Cambrian, with its unique continental configurations and burgeoning ecosystems, did these solar-driven oxygen pulses fuel such rapid evolutionary diversification.",

Correcting for this systematic bias yields a decelerating expansion at the present epoch and a rapidly evolving, weakening dark energy. Echoing DESI consortium hints, their Monthly Notices paper suggests dark energy could turn negative, risking a future big crunch. If confirmed, this paradigm-shifting result overturns nearly three decades of dark energy cosmology.",

There they reproduced Caral’s monumental pyramids, sunken plazas, and political-ideological layout, and left three-dimensional friezes depicting emaciated corpses, pregnant women, fish, toads and snakes to warn future generations. Artifacts show thriving trade networks across coast, Andes and Amazon, gender parity, open-air markets and Andean ritual symbols like pututu trumpets. Their peaceful, adaptive response to the 4.2ka mega-drought offers lessons on resilience to climate crises.",

The AI’s face-matching accuracy increased with visibility, peaking on data from super-recognisers at all visibility levels. Even when retinal samples covered equal areas, DNNs performed better with super-recogniser data, showing their advantage lies in selecting regions rich in identity clues, not simply sampling more pixels.

Elevating CIRBP in human cells doubled break repair; fruit flies with extra CIRBP showed increased lifespan and radiation resilience.

Across mostly 8-week trials, average weight change differed by up to 4kg: agomelatine about -2.5kg vs maprotiline about +2kg; nearly half on maprotiline/amitriptyline gained weight, while more than 50% on agomelatine lost. Heart rate varied by 21 bpm (fluvoxamine vs nortriptyline) and blood pressure by 11 mmHg (nortriptyline vs doxepin). SSRIs generally showed fewer physical effects. Authors (King's College London/Oxford) urge updating treatment guidelines, closer monitoring for some drugs, and shared decision-making to personalise choices. Antidepressants, often used up to two years, benefit many but are not interchangeable.",

They identified regulatory T cells (Tregs)—mature CD25+ T cells that suppress self-reactive T cells—and the central role of the FoxP3 gene, linking mutations to scurfy mice and human IPEX syndrome. The work reframed self-tolerance beyond thymic deletion, explaining autoimmunity risk and enabling therapies: boosting Tregs for autoimmune disease and transplants; inhibiting Tregs to enhance anti-cancer immunity. Prize: 11m SEK (~£871k). Experts called Tregs the immune system’s brakes, noting vast clinical potential.",

But matrilineality didn’t mean female rule; men’s brothers often decided. Examples include a 10th‑century elite in Chaco Canyon and an earlier farming community in eastern China. Power was multifaceted—soft and hard—evidenced by joint Bronze Age rulers, female warriors/hunters/shamans, and Iron Age Celtic pockets of matrilineality.

NASA and ESA are developing in‑situ Enceladus missions; Freissinet is building molecular detectors. Europa remains a top alternative.

Applications: ant‑derived cultures could seed plant‑based yoghurts or novel sourdough flavors. Rutgers’ Martin Blaser says this could diversify tastes beyond dominant industrial strains.

      "trailText": "Cranbrook, Kent: The wood here suddenly smells of autumn, and the smelliest fungus of all – the common stinkhorn – is also delicious",
      "summary": "Cranbrook, Kent diary evokes autumn’s damp, fungal scent and a search-by-smell for the common stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus). Found among bracken, its unmistakably phallic fruiting body is coated in fetid gleba—carrion-scented slime that attracts flies, which then ferry spores on their feet. Edible but unloved, it’s often eaten immature inside a jelly “witch’s egg,” with a radish-like bite. The author instead dries and grinds mature stinkhorns to deliver aged-beef-like umami to vegan dishes, flavor born of controlled decomposition. This solitary specimen is left to spread spores. The piece trails the Country Diary anthology Under the Changing Skies (2018–2024).",

Peace to German/Dutch/UK team showing a vodka shot subtly improves foreign‑language performance. Aviation: ethanol-dosed Egyptian fruit bats slowed and mis‑echolocated. Paediatrics: maternal garlic made babies suckle longer. Physics: cacio e pepe phase transition causing clumping. Nutrition: Togolese rainbow lizards preferred “four cheeses” pizza. Engineering: UV shoe‑rack deodorizer that singed trainers. Psychology: bogus “high IQ” boosts narcissism. Biology: zebra‑striped cows got fewer fly bites. Literature: William Bean’s 35‑year nail growth logs.",

Patrick Cosgrove (Bucknell, Shropshire) calls reviving the dodo (gone 300 years) futile, preferring cooperative Homo neanderthalensis. On St George's flag co-opted by the far right, Liz Conmy (Oxford) proposes a 'reclaim' heart emblem. Carol Haines (Yealmpton, Devon) recalls Bury's 'Weave now' sign. On Donald Trump, Geoffrey Cobb (Deal, Kent) notes emigrants fled such rule; Alan Barnes (Congleton, Cheshire) jokes about a 51st state visit (reports: 14 & 17 Sept).",
