Estimated 0.44–5.6 km across, it will pass much closer to the Sun than Borisov, likely shedding abundant gas/dust—rare, close-up samples of extrasolar building blocks. Hubble reveals a sunward “anti-tail,” implying uneven sublimation. ESO’s VLT finds a high nickel-to-iron ratio, possibly from sublimating nickel tetracarbonyl and iron pentacarbonyl; unusual polarization could arise from water ice and Mg-rich silicates. Entering near the ecliptic, its path skirts Jupiter, Mars and Venus but poses no threat; closest to Earth ~240 million km (>1.5 AU). While Avi Loeb speculates alien tech, consensus says natural. ESA Mars orbiters imaged its coma; it re-emerges for observing in late November.",

Her Gombe research revealed chimpanzee tool use, hunting and rich social lives, overturning orthodoxy and inspiring generations—especially women in science. Admirers hailed her tireless climate and biodiversity advocacy, globe-trotting outreach (often 300 days/year), and enduring legacy centering Africa and primate conservation. Leaders from Re:wild, IPBES, Mighty Earth and the African Wildlife Foundation vowed to carry her work forward.",

      "trailText": "Andy Holyer writes: She did not suffer fools gladly and had a mind like a steel trap",
      "summary": "Andy Holyer writes a tribute letter recalling Margaret “Maggie” Boden at the University of Sussex in 1991: hearing her on BBC Radio 4’s Today show, where, amid fashionable “end of history” debates, she rebutted an interviewee’s “end of science” claim in under 30 seconds. Holyer depicts Boden as a warm, loyal friend who nevertheless “did not suffer fools gladly,” praising her razor-sharp intellect—“a mind like a steel trap”—and concluding he never knew a finer one. The anecdote highlights her public intellectual clarity, speed of thought, and uncompromising rigor. Written in response to her obituary, the note memorializes her Sussex years and incisive presence on UK airwaves.",

      "summary": "US researchers analyzed 25 studies (mostly US), testing 77 interventions to reduce partisan animosity. Average effect: +5.4 points in warmth toward the opposing party on a 101-point scale—modest and smaller than routine public fluctuations, unlikely to alter misinformation beliefs or support for democratic norms. Effects faded fast: about 75% gone after one week, nearly all by two. Combining interventions (n=2,284) or repeating them three times (n=5,078) offered no advantage over a single exposure. Published in PNAS, the study argues no “magical fix”; durable change likely requires incentive reforms constraining elite/social-media polarization. Kurt Gray notes lasting cross-aisle relationships can still help.",

      "summary": "Chris Calladine, aged 90, was a Cambridge professor of structural mechanics and fellow of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering who bridged engineering and molecular biology. Working with Aaron Klug from the 1970s, he applied geodesic‑dome mechanics to microbiological structures, advancing models of bacterial flagella (1975), DNA (1982) and protein nanotubes (2001). His 1982 Calladine’s rules explained DNA bending and switching between forms after 1981 crystallography revised the Watson‑Crick view. He wrote the standard text Understanding DNA (1992). Beyond biophysics, he solved deep‑sea pipeline buckling and NASA helium‑balloon wrinkling. Nottingham-born; MIT MSc; taught at Cambridge 1960–retirement; married Mary Webb; three children, three grandchildren.",

New high-resolution seismic imaging, microscopic cuttings, and numerical models reveal a 2-mile-wide crater with a central peak and a 12-mile ring of concentric faults, overturning salt-tectonics claims. Discovered in 2002, a 2009 Geological Society vote was 80–20 against impact. Led by Uisdean Nicholson (Heriot-Watt) with NERC funding, the study appears in Nature Communications. Silverpit is the UK’s only known impact crater; marine examples are rare (33).",

The author instead dries and grinds mature stinkhorns to deliver aged-beef-like umami to vegan dishes, flavor born of controlled decomposition. This solitary specimen is left to spread spores.
