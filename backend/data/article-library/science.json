Her atlas highlights how local aromas—from mince pies and Chhena cake to stale beer dubbed “shattered dreams”—shape place identity and bridge sensory gaps in digital sharing.

Key morphological differences in the nuchal plane and cranial base support taxonomic separation, indicating a previously unrecognized branch in the hominin lineage. Prof Ronald Clarke originally named it A. prometheus, while others saw it as A. africanus. The authors urge the original excavation team to formally name and classify this potential new species.",

      "summary": "At the Future is Fungi Awards, innovators highlighted fungi’s potential—from Hiro’s self-composting diapers using freeze-dried fungi to digest plastics in under 12 months, to mycelium-grown packaging, biofoams, leather, insulation and fire-retardant firefighting foams. Companies like Michroma and Mycolever leverage fungal fermentation to produce natural pigments and emulsifiers, reducing petrochemical inputs. Mycelium’s thread-like networks build robust biocomposites from agricultural waste and secrete enzymes that break down wood, polyurethanes and some plastics, though PE and PP resist fast degradation. Researchers led by Adamatzky explore living fungal circuits for sensing and unconventional computing. Experts urge integrating fungi within broader sustainability strategies.",

      "summary": "Experts warn that high-profile investors like Elon Musk and Sam Altman are promoting transhumanist visions—brain uploading, human–AI merging—that distract from neurotechnology’s medical advances. Breakthroughs, from decoding inner speech to restoring vision, show real potential to treat ALS, Parkinson’s and paralysis. Yet hype-driven narratives risk muddying public debate, triggering counterproductive regulation and overshadowing mature research on medical implants, consumer EEG wearables and genuine brain–computer interfaces. Big tech—from Neuralink, Merge Labs, Apple to Meta—pour billions into medical devices, wearables and speculative sci-fi efforts. Scientists caution that biological limits make brain uploading implausible and that low-quality EEG gadgets pose privacy concerns.",

This find overturns prior Laurasian-only origin models, suggesting a Gondwanan birthplace for freshwater midges, highlights geographical bias in palaeontology, and underscores the rich fossil potential of southern continents.

In Science, Andrew Flynn (New Mexico State Univ) used argon-isotope geochronology plus magnetostratigraphy to show the unit hosting the youngest fossils formed at most 350,000 years before the 66 Ma extinction, within a short reversed-polarity chron. Assemblages indicate high regional variation: north: Triceratops, Edmontosaurus; south: crested duck-bills and giant sauropods like 30 m Alamosaurus, alongside T. rex. Co-author Steve Brusatte sees no pre-impact decline; Flynn cites sampling bias. Michael Benton welcomes the data but notes it is one site and broader records show declines (43 to 30 species) in western North America.",

      "summary": "Rhizanthella, a leafless, fully subterranean Australian orchid, flowers below ground and survives as a mycoheterotroph: its seeds and stems feed via a symbiotic fungus linked to broom bush (Melaleuca uncinata) roots. First unearthed by a ploughing farmer in Western Australia in 1928, it remains notoriously hard to locate; blooms are tiny reddish florets wrapped in creamy-pink bracts, vanilla-scented, likely pollinated by termites or minute flies. Only five species exist, among the world’s rarest orchids, now highly vulnerable from habitat loss and drought driven by climate breakdown. UWA botanist Kingsley Dixon is racing to conserve them by co-culturing seeds with the fungus and transplanting to potted Melaleuca hosts.",

His wife, Laura O’Neill, powered her phone while fixing their car, triggering a yell he first mistook for a grizzly. The committee, which initially reached only co‑laureate Shimon Sakaguchi (Osaka Univ), later contacted Ramsdell and Mary Brunkow (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle). The trio share SEK 11m (~£871k) for foundational discoveries on T‑cell function. Ramsdell’s San Francisco lab, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, said he was “off the grid.”",

In 1980s work on Josephson junctions in Clarke’s lab, the team observed voltage blips from whole-circuit tunnelling that followed probabilistic decay, proving quantum effects at circuit scale. The Royal Swedish Academy awarded SEK 11m (~£871k). Their results underpinned superconducting qubits, spurring quantum cryptography and computing; Martinis later led Google’s effort (2014–20). Clarke called the award a surprise; officials hailed quantum theory’s enduring utility.",

But matrilineality didn’t mean female rule; men’s brothers often decided. Examples include a 10th‑century elite in Chaco Canyon and an earlier farming community in eastern China. Power was multifaceted—soft and hard—evidenced by joint Bronze Age rulers, female warriors/hunters/shamans, and Iron Age Celtic pockets of matrilineality.

NASA and ESA are developing in‑situ Enceladus missions; Freissinet is building molecular detectors. Europa remains a top alternative.

Enucleated donor oocytes received skin-cell nuclei (46 chromosomes); after sperm fertilization, roscovitine induced extrusion of roughly half the chromosomes into a polar body. Resulting chromosome pairing was random, producing aneuploid embryos; fewer than 10% of 82 eggs reached the day 5/6 IVF transfer stage, and none were cultured beyond six days. Published in Nature Communications, the proof-of-concept could aid older women, cancer survivors, and same-sex male couples, but safety, efficiency, and governance may take about a decade to address.",

From London, look south-west about 19:30 BST with a clear southern horizon—ideally from a hill—as the pair are already setting in twilight. The moon is ~5.5 days old with just under 30% illumination. Visibility is far better in the southern hemisphere, where Antares (Scorpius) sits higher and the pair draw even closer. From parts of the southern Indian Ocean and Bouvet Island, the moon will occult Antares completely.",

      "summary": "Washington Post reports the Trump administration will claim prenatal Tylenol (acetaminophen/paracetamol) raises autism risk, despite guidelines. Trump teased he had found an answer to autism; health secretary RFK Jr cites environmental toxins. ACOG, RCOG and the NHS recommend paracetamol as first-line for pain/fever in pregnancy; NSAIDs in late pregnancy carry risks. Untreated fever/pain raises risks of congenital defects, preterm birth, low birth weight, miscarriage, and maternal complications. Evidence remains inconclusive: a 2024 Swedish cohort (2.5m) found no causal link; a 2025 review saw associations but not causation; large 2025 European/Japanese studies suggest confounding. US retailer lawsuits were dismissed in 2024; appeal pending.",

      "summary": "Scientists say the Silverpit structure, 80 miles off Yorkshire and 700 metres beneath the North Sea, is an impact crater formed about 43 million years ago by a York Minster-sized (about 160 m) asteroid, generating 100 m tsunami waves. New high-resolution seismic imaging, microscopic cuttings, and numerical models reveal a 2-mile-wide crater with a central peak and a 12-mile ring of concentric faults, overturning salt-tectonics claims. Discovered in 2002, a 2009 Geological Society vote was 80–20 against impact. Led by Uisdean Nicholson (Heriot-Watt) with NERC funding, the study appears in Nature Communications. Silverpit is the UK’s only known impact crater; marine examples are rare (33).",

Found among bracken, its unmistakably phallic fruiting body is coated in fetid gleba—carrion-scented slime that attracts flies, which then ferry spores on their feet. Edible but unloved, it’s often eaten immature inside a jelly “witch’s egg,” with a radish-like bite. The author instead dries and grinds mature stinkhorns to deliver aged-beef-like umami to vegan dishes, flavor born of controlled decomposition. This solitary specimen is left to spread spores. The piece trails the Country Diary anthology Under the Changing Skies (2018–2024).",
