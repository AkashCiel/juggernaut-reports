      "summary": "Firefox GM Anthony Enzor-DeMeo says AI-first browsers are early—paid AI ~3% globally, business models unclear. He’s tested Atlas, Comet, etc., and prefers answers with citations. He warns AI subscriptions could close the web. Firefox will add AI cautiously: fully optional, privacy-first, AI-agnostic sidebar (Copilot, Gemini, Perplexity); new Perplexity partnership, terms undisclosed. Users can refuse data storage, browse privately without login; less personalization by default. Generational splits: Gen Z favors personalization/choice; older cohorts lean privacy. On the Google trial, the judge preserved funding for independent browsers; AI–search monetization unresolved. Firefox still has ~200M users; neutrality amid launches (Atlas, Edge Copilot Mode, Comet, Chrome with Gemini) seen as growth.",

It enlisted 170 clinicians who reviewed 1,800 responses and shaped guidance. Researchers warn about sycophancy; OpenAI downplays causality.

Cuts span HR (People Experience and Technology) - potentially 15% - plus Devices and Services and Operations. Managers trained Monday to deliver email notices. Shares rose 1.2% ahead of earnings. Jassy is trimming bureaucracy and layers; an anonymous inefficiency line yielded 1,500 tips and 450 process changes. Peers Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet also downsized.",
