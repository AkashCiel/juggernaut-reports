After CEO Jean Innes resigned last month amid a staff revolt and ministerial pressure, chair Doug Gurr said 78 of the 440-staff institute’s research projects have been closed, spun out or completed to fit the new direction. ex-Air and Space Warfare Centre commander Blythe Crawford will report next month on supporting defence, national security and intelligence. Priorities: AI to forecast weather, oceans and sea ice for emergency planners; cut emissions in transport, manufacturing and infrastructure; and build digital heart twins. The shift follows an AWS outage and attacks disrupting Jaguar Land Rover, M&S and Co-op.",
