A new biography reveals his fear-driven ambition, dyslexic, ADHD background, obsessive fitness, eclectic lifestyle, and philosophical foundations from Frankfurt. Once championing liberal democracy, he now defends a Judeo-Christian west, courts Trump-era contracts, and rubs shoulders with Starmer. Palantir’s AI tools spark debates over civil liberties, military might and ideological drift as Karp pursues dominance akin to IBM’s 1960s era.",

In a landmark decision favoring music rights society GEMA (representing 100,000 composers and lyricists), the judge ordered undisclosed damages and rejected OpenAI’s claim that users, not the company, bear liability. GEMA and its counsel at Berlin’s Raue firm hailed the ruling as a clear signal to global tech firms, while OpenAI says it will appeal, argues the decision covers only a limited dataset and reaffirms respect for creators’ rights.",

Critics warn of legacy distortion; OpenAI also shifted to rights-holder opt-in after “Nazi Spongebob” complaints.",

Kido says it refused to pay the reported £600,000 bitcoin ransom, following police guidance. Sophos’ Rebecca Taylor said the deletion was damage control as credibility is crucial for extortion. Radiant’s leak site briefly showed Kido data, now removed; members posted they’ve banned targeting minors and erased under-19 records. The group claims >8,000 children’s files were taken, including accident/safeguarding reports and billing. Its revamped site solicits future victims and Tox contact. A hacker said they were \"sorry for hurting kids.\"",

The ICO welcomed it, saying ad targeting can’t be bundled into standard terms and users should be able to opt out—echoing Meta’s settlement with campaigner Tanya O’Carroll. By contrast, the EU said a similar pay-or-OK model breaches the Digital Markets Act, fining Meta €200m and urging a free, less data-intensive targeting option. Lawyers say this underscores UK–EU divergence and a pro-business UK regulatory tilt.",
