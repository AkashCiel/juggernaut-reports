They ordered USDA to tap $5.25 billion contingency funds (and potentially $23 billion reserves) to sustain November food stamp payments for 42 million low-income Americans. Plaintiffs—US cities, NGOs, a union, 22 states, DC, and governors—argued the suspension was unlawful. The administration, citing lack of authority until a spending bill passes, plans appeals. Trump vowed to comply if courts clarify funding authority, while states deploy emergency aid.",

Respondents—mostly white—split roughly one-third each as 2024 Trump voters, Harris voters, and others. Built in 1902 under Theodore Roosevelt and expanded by FDR in 1942, the East Wing housed the first lady’s staff and a secret war-era bunker. Trump had promised no demolition, claiming personal and private funding. Similar Yahoo/YouGov data show 61% opposition. Critics, including ex-official Elaine Kamarck, decry the project as an “abomination.”",

Ron DeSantis has directed the state Board of Governors to cease hiring international employees under the H-1B visa program, claiming it displaces qualified U.S. workers. Nearly 400 foreign nationals currently work at Florida’s public universities under H-1B visas, part of over 7,200 holders statewide. Legal experts say states lack authority to override federal visa regulations. DeSantis’s move follows Trump’s steep H-1B fee hike and assertion of “systematic abuse,” sparking debate over the program’s role in science and engineering faculties at UF, USF and FSU.",

      "summary": "An en banc Ninth Circuit panel will rehear whether Trump can deploy National Guard in Portland after vacating a three-judge panel’s decision in his favor. Two temporary restraining orders from Judge Karin Immergut bar federalizing Oregon guard forces and any Guard deployment statewide; a separate stay partly allowed Trump to command 200 Guard members. The dispute stems from federal claims of threats at an ICE facility and Oregon’s contention that local authorities control protests. AG Dan Rayfield says the ruling upholds constitutional limits on presidential military power in US cities.",

While troop pay is popular, critics fear it sets precedent for funding future executive priorities: domestic deployments to policy initiatives, undermining Congress’s power of the purse. Challenges face standing hurdles and unlikely prosecutions. Appropriators, GOP and Dems worry the usurpation damages trust and complicates future budget agreements.",

Despite vows to preserve existing structures, demolition proceeded without National Capital Planning Commission approval, provoking ire from historians, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and figures like David Frum. Major tech and defense corporations are among donors; completion is slated before Trump’s term ends in January 2029.",

The swift measures, which caught both Kremlin and Trump advisers off guard, aim to pressure Russia’s energy revenues but are unlikely to alter Putin’s war strategy, as Moscow insists a ceasefire must address Ukraine’s full concessions on Donbas and sovereignty.",

Trump denied deploying B-1 bombers near Venezuela amid speculation anti-narcotics missions mask efforts to oust President Nicolás Maduro. Critics, including Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly, warn that bombing and talk of regime change risk American lives and mirror past failed interventions.",

The two-minute video—reshared by journalist Prem Thakker—depicted an AI caricature of Mamdani plus stereotyped criminals: a shoplifting Black man in keffiyeh, a sex trafficker, a drug dealer, all shown pledging support. Critics including Shannon Watts, Laila Al-Arian and Benjamín Schultz-Figueroa denounced its racist tropes. It follows Cuomo’s earlier AI ads portraying himself in city roles and satirizing Bill de Blasio. Mamdani called Cuomo’s AI approach “fake Cuomo.”",

Sliwa quipped at both rivals, while Jewish safety became a flashpoint as Cuomo and Sliwa accused Mamdani of enabling antisemitism. Mamdani, accused of dodging education and zoning questions, defended his affordability agenda. With days to election, all three stuck to entrenched narratives.",

Kathy Castor and Maxwell Frost, urged Sec. of State Marco Rubio and the US ambassador to Israel to secure the swift release of 16-year-old Palestinian-American Mohammed Ibrahim, held in Israeli military detention since February. Arrested at 15 in a blindfolded, handcuffed predawn raid on his family’s West Bank home, Ibrahim has suffered weight loss, scabies and limited consular access. Signatories including Sanders, Warren, Schiff and Warnock demand a progress report by Nov. 3. The appeal coincides with Rubio’s Israel visit and amid concerns following the Gaza ceasefire transition talks.",

House Speaker Mike Johnson keeps the chamber in recess to pressure the Senate into adopting the GOP’s no-policy-additions bill, blaming Senate leader Chuck Schumer and nationwide No Kings protests. Hardliner Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly criticized Johnson’s strategy, signaling GOP fractures. Since Oct. 1, the shutdown—now the longest full US government shutdown—has led to furloughs of 1,400 NNSA nuclear staff. White House adviser Kevin Hassett expects a breakthrough this week.",

      "summary": "Disgraced ex-Congressman George Santos was released from a New Jersey federal prison on Oct. 18 after President Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, served under three months. Santos’s lawyer credited appeals from Trump plus GOP allies—Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Anna Paulina Luna, Matt Gaetz—and Justice Dept. officials. Convicted in August 2024, Santos had pleaded for clemency, citing harsh prison conditions. His release reignites debate over presidential pardon powers amid protests against perceived authoritarianism. Critics from both parties decry corruption; Democrats Hakeem Jeffries and Robert Zimmerman slammed the commutation; GOP’s Adam Kinzinger called it “corruption.”",

Trump publicly described the target as a “narco-sub” ferrying large cocaine loads. The attacks, invoking post-9/11 legal authority, have killed at least 28 crew. Human Rights Watch calls the operations extrajudicial, violating international law. Detainees now face unclear status—prisoners of war or criminal suspects. Criticism grows on Capitol Hill over lack of oversight amid a US military buildup and covert actions in Venezuela.",

Alaska mounted one of its largest airlifts, flying around 300 evacuees to a repurposed Anchorage arena while hundreds sheltered in schools in Bethel amid limited power and sanitation. Disaster workers from across the US have been deployed, but some locals may choose to stay. The storm killed one person and left two missing, highlighting federal mitigation cuts.",

Organized by decentralized 50501 (50 states, 50 protests), the rallies follow June demonstrations that drew millions. The appeal comes amid Trump’s use of troops in US cities, a –8 public approval rating in a recent Morning Consult poll and a looming partial government shutdown. De Niro, 80, warns democracy cannot be taken for granted.",

      "summary": "China reinstated export curbs on rare earth minerals—over 90% of processed supply—citing national security, prompting President Trump to levy 100% tariffs on all US-bound Chinese goods, scuttling ongoing trade talks. This escalation follows US export controls on semiconductor equipment. Average US-China tariffs now exceed 50% and 30% respectively. A TikTok divestment deal and congressional visit had hinted at détente, but both sides have since re-escalated, and Trump canceled plans to meet Xi at APEC. Markets initially plunged, rebounded on conciliatory US rhetoric; Beijing has vowed countermeasures. Deadline for a deal looms November 10.",

Warner shows the Trump administration moved 45% of agents in 25 largest FBI offices to ICE-led immigration raids, shifting 23% of the bureau’s 13,000 agents from cybercrime, counterterrorism, drug trafficking, espionage, violent crime and counterintelligence. Critics warn of national security gaps, low morale and civil rights risks as untrained agents join aggressive immigration sweeps. Former FBI agent Mike German calls the realignment unprecedented, potentially purging dissenters and elevating loyalists. Ex-agent Kenneth Gray warns that sustained focus on immigration over terror and cyber threats could leave the U.S. vulnerable. The DOJ and DHS have not commented.",

      "summary": "Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert launched her fourth term House campaign by pledging to uncover the “truth about UFOs,” accusing the federal government of suppressing evidence of unidentified anomalous phenomena. In an email to donors she blasted Washington bureaucrats for dismissing sightings and demanded full disclosure. Democratic analyst Andy Boian called the move a “cry for help” amid her fundraising and voter support challenges, though her campaign says donor interest is strong. A QAnon adherent, Boebert previously pressed Congress in November 2024 on underwater alien bases and narrowly won reelection in 2022 and 2024.",

      "summary": "A Supreme Court panel on October 8 considered Republican Mike Bost’s challenge to an Illinois law allowing mail-in absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted up to two weeks later. Bost argues the extension unconstitutionally prolongs elections and that campaign staffing costs give him standing. Justices probed whether a federal candidate is a direct “object” of the rule and if the statistical chance of late ballots affecting results matters for standing. Lower courts dismissed Bost for lack of injury; his appeal emphasizes financial harm and broader implications amid GOP efforts, including Trump’s directives against post-Election Day mail ballots. ACLU backs his standing claim.",

JB Pritzker and AG Kwame Raoul sued to stop the move, arguing it violates state sovereignty. The judge gave the administration until Wednesday to respond. Trump is also seeking to federalize 300 Illinois guardsmen and send 400 more from Texas. In Congress Republicans cheered the deployment while Democrats grilled AG Pam Bondi over presidential authority, with critics warning of constitutional overreach. A similar effort to send troops to Portland was blocked by an Oregon judge.",

Installed US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, a Trump loyalist with no prosecutorial experience, is set to review Yusi’s findings after referrals by FHFA head William Pulte, who alleged James misrepresented her primary residence on 2023 mortgage documents. Emails and filings indicate James disclosed she did not intend to occupy the Norfolk home as her main residence. Grand jury proceedings in May faltered, and several prosecutors have been ousted amid the high‐stakes confrontation between Trump and the Justice Department.",

After deleting the latter, aides offered no real explanation. Offline, he’s made confounding claims—linking Tylenol to autism, confusing Albania with Armenia, and posting gold-fixture tours amid news of a church shooting—while in a Virginia military meeting he delivered a disjointed, partisan address on Iran strikes, stairs-safety anecdotes and using “dangerous” US cities as training grounds, prompting bipartisan alarm over his fitness.",

Conservationists warn clear-cut roads and lost root systems risk leaching coal-waste toxins into the Ohio River watershed, harming endangered hellbender salamanders and local drinking water, while increasing fire, landslide and flood hazards. Though timber sales can generate jobs in economically deprived Appalachian counties, critics note that road-building costs often exceed revenue and question logging public lands amid private forest abundance and $3.5 bn timber exports.",

With the House adjourned amid a shutdown over funding, Johnson says he’ll swear her in only once the chamber reopens, leaving her unable to serve constituents.",

Rightwing commentator Nick Sortor was arrested after a fight, then freed, spurring DHS secretary Kristi Noem to promise an ICE “surge.” A coalition of 17 Oregon mayors and AG Dan Rayfield sued to block 200 federalized guard members; a judge will hear arguments Friday. Trump’s hardline immigration measures, antifa terrorist designation, and past federal interventions in Portland, LA, DC, Chicago and Memphis underscore this latest enforcement push.",

Press sec. Karoline Leavitt and OMB chief Russ Vought warn of imminent layoffs and pause billions in infrastructure and clean-energy grants to Democratic states. Democratic leaders Jeffries and Schumer counter that Republicans orchestrated the shutdown to advance an extreme agenda amid bitter brinkmanship and social-media attacks.",

Republicans proposed a stopgap bill to extend funding to Nov. 21, but Democrats withheld support over demands to extend ACA subsidies, roll back Medicaid cuts and restore public media funding. The White House has threatened permanent layoffs, directing agencies via an OMB memo to prepare reduction-in-force notices. Non-essential services from national parks to food inspections will pause, while Social Security, Medicare, military and air traffic control continue.

Chellie Pingree and trial attorneys decry these “sneaky” provisions as unconstitutional, warning they strip consumers of legal recourse and obstruct new health risk warnings. Bayer argues federal certainty is needed to protect research and investments and disputes that the language precludes lawsuits, while also threatening to halt glyphosate sales if litigation persists.",

Despite President Trump’s campaign promise and the FBI’s claim to be “releasing as much as legally allowed,” DOJ officials insist no client list exists and refuse further disclosure. Survivors and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie point to documents identifying at least 20 men to whom Epstein allegedly trafficked victims, contradicting FBI counsel Kash Patel’s assertion of no credible evidence. Michaels decries systemic neglect, bipartisan frustration, and urges lawmakers to ‘find it in your heart to seek the truth.’",

Comey testified to the Senate about Trump’s loyalty demands and published a memoir accusing Trump of unethical leadership. After Trump’s 2025 return the Secret Service surveilled Comey over a deleted anti-Trump post. In September 2025 a grand jury indicted Comey for false statements and obstructing Congress; prosecutors and Senate Democrats condemned it as weaponizing justice. Comey pleaded innocence; Trump celebrated on Truth Social.",

      "summary": "Donald Trump’s presidential memorandum directs the FBI, DOJ and Treasury to “investigate, disrupt and dismantle” what he labels a radical leftwing domestic terror network. He hinted at targeting funders such as George Soros and Reid Hoffman, drawing swift legal and civil liberties pushback from the ACLU. Legal experts argue the memo adds no new crimes but risks politically selective enforcement. Announced amid fallout from Charlie Kirk’s murder and a Dallas ICE attack, the plan—hailed by Stephen Miller—lumps disparate violent incidents under antifa, raising fears of broad suppression of dissent.",

Outdoor workers may lose $55.4 billion in future earnings by 2050 due to extreme heat and poor air quality.

      "summary": "After abandoning his earlier push for Kyiv to cede Donetsk, Trump now asserts Ukraine can retake all its territory, marking a strategic tone shift but offering only limited measures: tougher sanctions (mainly aimed at India, not China), European-funded U.S. arms shipments, and no new air-defense aid. Analysts argue that real battlefield gains require heavier Western weapon supplies, improved air defense, or unlikely direct military intervention, or a Russian collapse. Kyiv itself has acknowledged that diplomatic negotiations will be needed to recover regions occupied since 2014.",

Spearheaded by Doug McConnell's A Long Swim and ecologist group Friends of the Chicago River, the event met EPA fecal coliform safety standards. Once so fetid it sparked cholera outbreaks and earned the savage nickname 'bubble creek,' the revived waterway now sustains fish, beavers and public recreation. Olympian Olivia Smoliga competed among vetted participants. This milestone showcases 50 years of river cleanup under the Clean Water Act but flags threats from federal rollbacks to pollution protections.",

Announced hours before his call with Xi Jinping, who touted progress on trade, fentanyl and TikTok and planned a Korea summit, the move alarmed arms dealers and analysts. They warn this tactical concession could be exploited by Beijing and solidify a low-support stance, prompting Taiwan to boost defense spending toward 5% of GDP.",

Major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair also pulled episodes, citing objections and pressure while seeking FCC approvals. Labor and free speech groups, including the Working Families Party and 50501, launched viral guides urging a boycott of Disney-ABC, Nexstar and Sinclair, framing the suspension as state-sanctioned censorship. Activists rallied on social media under #BoycottDisney. Critics warn this sets an authoritarian precedent. Trump celebrated the cancellation on social media. House Democrats and PEN America condemned ABC’s decision, demanding FCC chair Carr’s resignation.",

      "summary": "US climate activists will host over 200 'Sun Day' events this Sunday, led by Bill McKibben and 350.org, to celebrate solar power and energy efficiency and counter Trump’s 150-plus anti-renewable actions since January. Showcasing installations—from Habitat for Humanity solar panels and electric school buses in Virginia to electric Ford F-150–powered concerts in New Hampshire—Sun Day replaces defensive climate marches with proactive celebrations. High-profile gatherings in Union Square feature Jane Fonda and Antonique Smith performing Here Comes the Sun; local efforts include Indigenous dances in Oregon, net-zero fire stations in New Paltz and solar home tours in DC. Organizers hope this optimistic approach will broaden the climate movement’s appeal amid regulatory rollbacks and rising US emissions.",

State inspectors flagged oil-soaked grounds and failed wastewater treatment.

Critics say using the largest US maximum-security prison, with a legacy of brutality, forced farm labor and racial violence on a former plantation site, blurs civil immigration detention and criminal incarceration. Detainees lack guaranteed counsel, transparency over renovations and management is murky, and ongoing lawsuits challenge abusive conditions.",
