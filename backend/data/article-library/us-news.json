      "summary": "Donald Trump ordered the US bombardment of Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro, marking the first direct US military attack on a South American country and signaling a return to Monroe doctrine–style “naked imperialism.” Citing a new national security strategy that calls for an expanded military presence, Trump declared “American dominance” in the hemisphere unassailable. This unprecedented operation echoes earlier interventions—from the 1847 US invasion of Mexico, the 1898 Cuba occupation, 1915 Haiti invasion, Cold War–era coups and Operation Condor, to the 1989 Panama Noriega seizure—and raises doubts about long-term stability or democracy in Venezuela.",

Republicans hailed enforcement of a 2020 narco-trafficking indictment; Democrats and global powers—including France, China and Russia—condemned the operation as illegal imperialism evoking Iraq.

      "summary": "Rescuers recovered the body of 55-year-old triathlete Erica Fox on Dec. 28 at Davenport Beach, north of Santa Cruz, nearly a week after she disappeared during a group swim from Monterey’s Lovers Point. Witnesses reported seeing a shark carrying human remains. Fox’s husband Jean-François Vanreusel and swim-club members held a memorial walk; her father praised her kindness and passion for ocean swimming. A multi-agency search—including Coast Guard, fire and police—had been suspended after covering 84 nautical miles. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office is investigating. Fox competed in triathlons including Escape From Alcatraz, marking California’s 16th shark-related fatality in 75 years.",

      "summary": "Since fall 2023, US overdose deaths have fallen unevenly across states, with West Virginia among those posting the steepest declines—an effect experts link in part to expanded crisis intervention training (CIT) for police. Initially designed in the late 1980s to help officers identify mental health crises, modern CIT teaches them to recognize substance use disorders, engage empathetically, avoid arrest, and arrange ‘warm handoffs’ to treatment rather than jail. Advocates like Wheeling’s CIT supervisor Yolandah Mwikisa and Brookings fellow Richard Frank say this approach not only reduces fatal overdoses and crime drivers but also lowers liability for departments, challenging skeptics who favor incarceration over treatment.",

These funds are part of $1 billion in annual counterterrorism and emergency disaster support. In a scathing 48-page opinion, McElroy decried the “wanton abuse” of grant administration, citing the Brown University mass shooting response as illustrative of these programs’ critical role. A coalition of 12 state attorneys general, led by NY AG Letitia James, celebrated the ruling. DHS plans to appeal.",

      "summary": "The DOJ briefly removed then restored a photograph showing Donald Trump from its Jeffrey Epstein investigative file release after New York prosecutors flagged it for possible victim exposure. Democrats accused the department of political interference, while Deputy AG Todd Blanche insisted the pull-down—one of 16—was driven by victim advocacy concerns and that files will return once redaction needs are assessed. Survivor rights attorney Gloria Allred lamented under-redaction of names and images, and a victim’s letter highlighted inconsistencies in identity protections. House Democrats, led by Hakeem Jeffries, argued the partial dump violated the Epstein Files Transparency Act, while Republicans countered that prior releases had been politicized. The dispute over redactions and selective disclosures underscores ongoing partisan battles over full public access to Epstein’s records.",

Since 2019 the state added 30,800 MW of solar, wind and storage, boosting battery capacity from 771 MW to nearly 17,000 MW to smooth intermittent output. California targets 60% zero-carbon by 2030 and 100% by 2045, with renewables (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass) and nuclear supplying peaks while natural gas—still 35% of generation—fell 8% in 2024. Facing federal rollbacks under Trump, the state is suing to defend its clean-energy agenda and plans to expand rooftop solar and phase out gas plants.",

At the State Department, Senator Marco Rubio affirmed the right to use “every element of national power” to defend US interests, hinting at regime change. US forces recently seized a sanctioned tanker, disrupting Maduro’s “dark fleet”—many vessels are now diverting to the Indian Ocean or trapped in blockade zones, cutting key oil revenues. Experts say the blockade raises prospects of unseating Maduro by starving his government.",

Experts attribute the drop partly to increased openness about psychiatric struggles—diagnoses of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and ADHD have surged since 2019 (Fair Health data)—and partly to pandemic trauma, political/economic uncertainty and social disconnection. Self-ratings fell most sharply among college graduates and Republicans, narrowing historical gaps and signaling broad, shared distress alongside growing willingness to acknowledge mental health issues.",

The Mesa Lab closure threatens 830 staff, two research aircraft and a Wyoming supercomputer. Gov. Jared Polis warns the move endangers public safety by undermining data for fires, floods and cyclones. OMB director Russell Vought led the action, calling some programs wasteful including an Indigenous sciences initiative. Critics say shuttering NCAR undermines U.S. leadership in atmospheric science. It follows broader Trump scepticism, including proposed 30% NOAA climate cuts.",

Bipartisan outrage ensued: Patrick Schwarzenegger and Whoopi Goldberg called his post “vile,” while Governor Newsom, Senators Murphy, Representatives Frost, Lofgren and Greene condemned the attack. GOP’s Greene and Thomas Massie urged empathy for the family. Police arrested their son Nick, 32, on murder charges, bail set at $4 million.",

      "summary": "Former senator Joe Manchin on WABC called on lawmakers to abandon “attack mode,” urging Democrats and Republicans to cool rhetoric and form a “sensible majority” free of far-left and far-right influences. His appeal echoes Erika Kirk’s town-hall plea after her husband Charlie Kirk’s September killing. Manchin stressed civil disagreement—“you are not the enemy”—and warned that intense partisanship risks fueling recent political violence in the US, which has included two assassination attempts on Donald Trump, a firebombing at Gov. Josh Shapiro��s residence and the murders of Charlie Kirk and ex-Minnesota speaker Melissa Hortman. Republican Sen. Rand Paul also cautioned that aggressive redistricting could heighten tensions before 2026.",

Experts warn this adverse selection will trigger a “death spiral,” raising costs further as healthier consumers exit. Rural hospitals, already reliant on ACA patients, face rising uncompensated care and potential closures or price hikes affecting employer-insured Americans.

      "summary": "Katie Miller’s eponymous podcast positions itself as a soft-entry point for conservative women into MAGA culture, blending family, faith and anti-establishment talking points—seed oils, anti-Trump protesters and transgender “ideology”—with instructions on motherhood. Guests like Pete Hegseth, JD Vance and Kellyanne Conway face softball queries on godly conduct and domestic routines, while vaccine skepticism and anti–birth-control rhetoric underscore a “womanosphere” ethos. Despite high-profile access, Miller’s lack of chemistry and overly polished, generic interviews render the show vibeless and ineffective at authenticating or expanding Trump’s appeal among female audiences.",

Though nonbinding and likely unread by Trump, its anti-immigrant, anti-EU tenor aligns with his instincts.

Citing strong merits, the judge said upholding due process is vital. Ábrego, deported earlier to an El Salvador prison under Trump’s aggressive immigration policy, returned to Maryland where he lives with his US wife and child. He vowed to keep fighting additional deportation attempts and criminal charges while supporters rallied behind him. He also faces human smuggling charges in Tennessee.",

      "summary": "Senior Democratic lawmakers and at least one Republican criticized Trump’s seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker as evidence of an aggressive military posture aimed at regime change, warning he’s ‘sleepwalking us into a war.’ Senators Van Hollen, Paul, Coons and Warner decried the operation’s pretext of drug interdiction and its inconsistent priorities, while Schumer lamented Trump’s erratic messaging. Attorney General Bondi defended the seizure as targeting oil shipments fueling terrorism. Venezuela denounced it as piracy. A bipartisan war powers resolution to curb unauthorized military action is pending.",

Mangione is charged with fatally shooting United Healthcare exec Brian Thompson with a ghost gun, igniting public outrage over for-profit healthcare, inequality and gun violence. Testimony ranged from a McDonald’s tipster suspicious of a mask-wearing suspect to a guard invoking Epstein-style precautions, and culminated in the forcible ejection of a reporter challenging sealed evidence. Mangione, pleading not guilty, contests warrantless searches and Miranda issues, underscoring America’s adversarial system.",

      "summary": "Donald Trump’s signed US National Security Strategy warns Europe faces ��civilisational erasure” within 20 years from migration, EU integration and loss of national identity, echoing the racist “great replacement” theory. It explicitly urges Washington to “cultivate resistance” by backing nationalist far-right parties, opening European markets to US goods and shifting defence burdens onto EU states. The paper criticizes EU censorship and regulatory “suffocation,” calls for an end to the Ukraine war favouring Russia, and celebrates rising patriotic parties like Germany’s AfD. Germany’s foreign minister rebuffs US interference, while Democrats denounce contradictions and pro-Russia leanings.",

In a Dec. 5 hearing, he noted conditions in L.A. have since improved, questioned why state forces couldn’t secure federal sites, and recalled his earlier ruling deeming the activation illegal. California Governor Newsom’s suit seeks a preliminary injunction to return control of the guard, but an appeals panel has stayed Breyer’s order. DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton argued presidential power permits extended command while a crisis persists. This unprecedented deployment tests limits on domestic military use.",

Hegseth refused questioning, claiming declassification authority; an unclassified version is due soon. Meanwhile, Republican senators led by Rand Paul question the administration’s rationale for dual Caribbean drug-boat strikes. Other key developments: new images of Epstein’s Caribbean island released; ICE raids in New Orleans; Trump pardons Rep. Henry Cuellar; Colombia warns Trump over drug threats; Biden-era fuel standards repealed and some travel bans paused.",

      "summary": "Leaked memo shows the VA is building by Dec 30 a comprehensive internal database of non-US-citizen employees, contractors, trainees and volunteers, to share ‘adverse findings’ with ‘appropriate agencies,’ likely including ICE. Officials justify it under federal vetting laws but exclude US citizens. Critics warn permanent residents and veteran staff face deportation risks, undermining workforce morale and patient safety. Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez labels it an authoritarian list-making tactic. The move echoes Trump’s expanded interagency data-sharing push and fuels fears of intimidation of legally present workers.",

Authored by bipartisan Council Minority Leader Joann Ariola and backed by the Uniformed Firefighters Association, it faces pushback from the American Chemistry Council but gains momentum from the NFPA’s new PFAS-free gear standard.",

The pardon announcement accompanied his endorsement of Tito Asfura in Sunday’s tight Honduran election, which the OAS and Washington are closely monitoring amid concerns of disputed results.",

Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander defended the paper’s fact-based reporting and condemned the personal insults. The episode follows Trump’s history of disparaging female journalists—calling Bloomberg’s Catherine Lucey “piggy,” ABC’s Mary Bruce “terrible,” and dismissing Megyn Kelly on gendered grounds—raising fresh concerns over press freedom and gender bias.",

Scouting America, surprised and disappointed, insists its nonpartisan tradition and crucial role in officer recruitment—where Eagle Scouts receive academy and enlistment benefits—will continue despite the threat.",

Other developments: experts say Trump’s pardons may cover 2020 voter fraud; envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow on Ukraine; anti-fascist terror labels criticized; 70% of Latinos now disapprove of Trump; ICE raids, a $5m tax settlement, BBC-Trump row, and new CDC deputy also made news.",

      "summary": "Classified DOJ Office of Legal Counsel memo contends Trump administration’s Caribbean boat strikes against drug cartels are lawful collective self-defense on behalf of allies like Mexico and Colombia, premised on unverified claims that cartels wage armed violence funded by cocaine proceeds. This legal framing, invoking the law of armed conflict to bypass murder statutes and congressional approval, contrasts with Trump���s public portrayal as anti-overdose action. Critics note scant evidence cartels constitute an armed enemy or sought US military aid. It coincides with an expanded campaign featuring the USS Gerald Ford and Hegseth’s threats against lawmakers questioning orders.",

      "summary": "Federal judge Cameron McGowan Currie vacated criminal indictments against ex–FBI director James Comey and NY attorney general Letitia James after finding that interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan—appointed by Trump—lacked any lawful authority to bring charges. Currie called all actions stemming from Halligan’s defective appointment “unlawful exercises of executive power” and dismissed the cases without prejudice. Although refiled prosecutions remain theoretically possible, Comey’s statute of limitations on the 2018 false-statement charge expired on September 30, 2025. Both defendants hailed the ruling as a vindication against politically motivated targeting.",

Last week’s law cleared release of investigative files, Clayton says, but Judge Richard Berman previously denied a Trump-era petition citing privacy risks to victims and the transcripts’ limited new information. A parallel bid to free Ghislaine Maxwell testimony was also rejected. Clayton’s request follows his assignment to probe Epstein’s ties to Democrats and high-profile prosecutorial shifts.",

GOP ally Thomas Massie praised her honesty; Trump branded her a “traitor” over low poll numbers but later said he’d back a return. Parkland survivor David Hogg and ex-Rep.

Under military law sedition carries death; civilians face up to 20-year sentences. Kelly cautioned that Trump’s incendiary language risks fueling the rising tide of political violence.",

The informal backchannel’s White House support remains unclear. The proposal surfaced as Russian strikes killed at least 25 in Ternopil. Separately, Trump signed a bill mandating DOJ release all Epstein files and sparked outrage calling a reporter “piggy.”",

Triggered by a bipartisan petition and Trump’s late support, the House vote this week on forcing release of Epstein-related government files is expected to pass narrowly but faces an uncertain Senate fate.",

Under state law, inmates choose between firing squad, electrocution or lethal injection; rights groups condemn gunfire as “barbaric” amid broader US concerns over botched executions and painful methods. SC now rivals Utah in modern-era shooting executions.",

      "summary": "Donald Trump granted a full pardon to British billionaire Joe Lewis, overturning his 2024 conviction for a ‘brazen’ insider-trading scheme that resulted in a $5 million personal fine, $44 million corporate penalty and three years’ probation but no jail time. The 88-year-old former Tottenham Hotspur owner pleaded guilty after prosecutors detailed tip-offs to friends, employees and a romantic partner. He also owns a major stake in pub operator Mitchells & Butlers and transferred Tottenham’s control to a family trust in 2022. Lewis sought the pardon to obtain medical treatment and visit family in the US.",

The viral video prompted police to secure an arrest warrant; McClintock later withdrew from MSU. Police emphasized that offensive words are protected but intervened when behavior threatened public safety. Portnoy, who is Jewish, released his pizza review footage alongside a response labeling McClintock a “loser” and warning of a “definitive shift” toward antisemitism in America during a CBS interview.",

Progressive groups (Our Revolution, Indivisible), strategists (Rick Wilson) and House Democrats (Levin, Khanna, Tlaib) accused Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of leadership failure, demanding his immediate resignation. While Schumer publicly opposed the deal and abstained in a key procedural vote, critics argue he secretly enabled or failed to control his caucus. House and Senate leaders Jeffries and GOP counterparts remain largely silent amid rising intra-party tensions.",

The injunction follows an earlier restraining order, a lawsuit by Portland and Oregon, and testimony from law enforcement. Oregon AG Dan Rayfield called it a “huge victory,” and the administration plans to appeal.",

ICE denies targeting the daycare, claiming agents pursued a vehicle. The arrest coincided with a lawsuit alleging a pattern of excessive force by ICE.",

As part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, troops have aided in 1,500+ arrests; Memphis Mayor Paul Young declined to join, instead seeking to shape troop operations despite doubts about effectiveness.",

Pritzker’s plea to pause enforcement, federal agents pepper-sprayed crowds on Oct. 25 and arrested alleged suspects near a middle school in Evanston on Oct. 31. Families say fear has emptied streets previously alive with trick-or-treaters, vendors and marigold-lined altars. Parents like Cecilia Romero and Marco DeSantiago describe a somber mood as children miss out on traditions. Community organizers pressed on with reduced-attendance altars and processions, determined to uphold cultural rituals amid heightened immigration enforcement.",

Florida now accounts for nearly 40% of US executions in 2025. A 2023 law cutting jury unanimity to eight out of 12 has expedited death sentences, despite 30 exonerations from death row.",

Noem refused, defending continued operations to “keep communities safe,” lamenting threats against ICE officers and condemning the governor’s plea as “shameful.” Pritzker fired back on social media, mocking Noem’s law enforcement–themed costumes and decrying policies that risk “tear gassing children trick-or-treating.”",

Posing as workers, Rosenberg and associates took the birds, claiming a rescue from cruelty at a Perdue Farms supplier. Prosecutors dismissed her motive; her legal team plans to appeal. She faces over five years in prison. Critics decry spending six weeks and hundreds of thousands in public funds protecting a multibillion-dollar poultry firm from a $25 animal rescue. The trial, held in agriculture-driven Sonoma County, follows a DxE co-founder’s conviction two years earlier for farm protests.",

Trump praised Republicans like JD Vance and Marco Rubio as capable successors. On his five-day Asia tour ahead of APEC and ASEAN summits, he touted new Southeast Asia trade and critical minerals pacts and anticipates a truce-like deal with Xi Jinping.",

Against the backdrop of Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and evolving Jewish debates over Israel, polls show 43% of Jewish New Yorkers backing him (67% under 44). Conservative rabbis led by Elliot Cosgrove denounce him as a threat, while the Jewish left and younger voters embrace his anti-hate and affordability agenda. Through private synagogue meet-and-greets, Mamdani addresses antisemitism and economic issues, forcing intra-Jewish reckonings over Zionism, two-state reality and communal identity ahead of November’s vote.",

Brought by Trump-appointed US attorney Lindsey Halligan over career prosecutors' objections, the indictment alleges she misled lenders despite minimal rental profit and family occupants. James plans to move to dismiss for improper appointment. Defense calls the case political retribution amid broader DOJ pressure for Trump-targeted prosecutions.",

      "summary": "The US imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil—Russia’s two largest oil firms—to penalize Putin’s refusal to end the Ukraine war. As the first Russian energy sanctions under Trump since January, they target oil tax revenues that supply about a quarter of Moscow’s budget, aiming to strangle financing for the Kremlin’s war machine and force an immediate ceasefire. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “now is the time to stop the killing.” Nonetheless, analysts at the Council on Foreign Relations warn the Kremlin has been adept at evading such restrictions.",

Historians likened it to defacing a masterpiece. The White House cited past expansions. Observers note Trump’s second-term pivot from a stalling economy to foreign policy and real estate nostalgia, echoing Mar-a-Lago opulence. He also unveiled plans for a gold-topped triumphal arch dubbed 'Arc de Trump.'",

Garcia says these revelations contradict Justice Department claims that further inquiry wasn’t warranted and warns Bondi’s refusal to comply with an August subpoena raises questions about her motives. The committee, investigating Epstein’s 2019 death, has released thousands of pages of documents and may force a vote on legislation to unlock more files once the shutdown ends.",

Both were hospitalized. Parias has been charged with assault on a federal officer, facing up to eight years in prison. DHS blamed “sanctuary” rhetoric for rising violence, citing unverified ICE attack data, while immigration activists decry increasingly aggressive federal tactics amid recent raid fatalities.",

Class-action lawsuits from ICE facilities in New York, Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” and Guantánamo report similar 24/7 illumination. Circadian experts warn that lack of bright days and excess nighttime light increases risks of sleep disorders, metabolic, immune and mental-health problems. ICE and GEO Group reject these claims, pointing to vague detention standards with no federal lighting guidelines. Advocates and scientists call for low-cost fixes—scheduled outdoor access, dim night bulbs, eye masks—and binding standards to safeguard detainees’ health and dignity.",

He defended turning the case to Florida state authorities, cited victims’ MySpace histories and prior records as cross-examination risks, and denied any role by Donald Trump. The transcript’s release coincides with scrutiny of Florida AG Pam Bondi’s withheld files, Rep. Garcia’s subpoenas and unanswered questions over Epstein’s accountability.",

Drawing on his Harlem upbringing and his office’s work against ghost guns—pushing legislation to ban 3D-printed firearms, urging YouTube to block build tutorials and collaborating with printer makers—Bragg aims to share trauma-informed prosecution and community intervention strategies nationwide. He will leverage partnerships with nonprofits and fellow prosecutors to address the disproportionate impact of gun violence on Black and Latino communities, even as federal grant cuts strain local violence-prevention programs.",

He urged service members to question illegal orders and warned that unchecked executive overreach risks collapse of the constitutional system if voters and lawmakers fail to clarify presidential limits.",

Plaintiffs, led by Our Children’s Trust counsel Julia Olson, vow to appeal.

      "summary": "During the federal shutdown, the Trump administration abruptly axed about 4,200 employees across seven agencies—though 700 CDC cuts were later reversed—sparking confusion as furloughed staff can’t access government email to confirm RIF notices. Unions sued and won an injunction against March’s forceful Education Department reductions; a hearing on fresh firings is set Wednesday. New notices hit special education programs the day before their longtime director’s funeral, cutting staff from over 4,100 at Trump’s inauguration to under 2,000. Unions warn these cuts imperil K-12, disability services and sow anxiety across other agencies awaiting further job losses.",

Championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas tied to Donald Trump, Prop 50 seeks independent mapmaking and a level electoral playing field. Obama warns Republicans aim to rig future elections, calls voters to return ballots immediately, and cites Emerson polling showing 51% support vs. 34% opposition, with 15% undecided.",

Emergency crews, hampered by secondary blasts, scoured the rubble for survivors and evidence as sheriff Chris Davis described the site as ‘gone’ and urged residents to report debris. Homes miles away shook, with footage showing burning debris and damaged vehicles, and McEwen’s mayor called it a community tragedy. Governor Bill Lee mobilized state and federal agencies; the cause remains under investigation.",

Anthropologist Daniella Santoro and husband Aaron Lorenz recognized its Latin inscription, consulted archaeologists who linked it to a missing Civitavecchia museum piece, and handed it to the FBI art crime team for repatriation.",

      "summary": "Texas AG Ken Paxton announced the arrest of eight individuals indicted alongside midwife Maria Rojas, the first charged under Texas’ near-total abortion ban, accusing them of practicing medicine without licenses. Rojas faces charges of performing three abortions and 12 counts of unlicensed medical practice at her three Houston clinics. Paxton, calling them “abortion-loving radicals,” vows to enforce pro-life laws. Rojas’ lawyers counter that misoprostol possession and delegated tasks by assistants don’t prove illegal abortions or independent practice. The case, unfolding since Rojas’s March arrest, reflects intensifying state-level abortion bans post-Roe.",

She refused to discuss White House pressure on personnel decisions, denied an Epstein client list exists, defended Operation Arctic Frost as law enforcement overreach, and clashed over FBI actions against senators’ phone records. Bondi countered by attacking Democrats personally, invoking troop deployments to Chicago and pivoting to Hunter Biden criticisms.",

In messages viewed publicly in Minnesota, Salisbury conferred with Patrick Weaver, adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who sought President Trump’s explicit go-ahead amid concerns about backlash over using active-duty troops. Weaver noted Hegseth preferred National Guard forces to avoid headlines. Hegseth later announced 200 guard personnel “immediately” but local reports say none are yet in place. The White House defended Salisbury, calling the leaks unclassified and criticizing reporters. This follows previous administration Signal leaks.",

OMB director Russ Vought framed the pause as a pushback against “diversity efforts” in the Democratic-led city amid the partial government shutdown. Vought previously halted $18bn for New York’s Hudson River tunnel and Second Avenue Subway under the same rationale. These funding delays, part of a broader political pressure campaign, face likely legal challenges.",

One video falsely depicts Schumer calling Democrats \"woke pieces of shit,\" the other superimposes a sombrero and mustache on Jeffries, set to mariachi music. Posted on Trump's social media, the clips support a false claim that Democrats demanded ACA subsidies for unauthorized immigrants; undocumented people are ineligible. Vice-President JD Vance joked the \"sombrero memes\" would end if Democrats reopened the government. The fabrications echo the white supremacist \"great replacement\" conspiracy. Jeffries decried the depictions as racist.",

AG Liz Murrill called the providers “criminal drug dealers.” Similar actions target Dr Margaret Carpenter in Texas and NY, with legal experts expecting Supreme Court review.",

He criticized Trump’s installation of Lindsey Halligan—a personal lawyer with no prosecutorial experience known for downplaying slavery at the Smithsonian—to pursue Comey charges, and warned that any of Trump’s opponents faced similar retaliation.",

Local leaders – Governor Tina Kotek, Mayor Keith Wilson and Congressional Democrats – say Portland is peaceful, with only a small protest outside an ICE office, and reject any request for troops. Videos cited by Trump were outdated or misleading, they say. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, Representatives Suzanne Bonamici and Maxine Dexter denounced the move as authoritarian, unnecessary and based on false reporting.

Critics note many arrests are collateral, sweeping up long-term residents and visa holders, exemplified by raids at a Georgia Hyundai site. DHS insists 70% of arrestees have criminal records, but advocates warn civil infractions are being treated as crimes amid record detention levels.",

      "summary": "Aakash Singh, 33, an associate deputy attorney general appointed under Trump to spearhead aggressive misdemeanor and protest prosecutions in DC and LA, pleaded guilty to a 2021 Level 5 DUI in Raleigh, where he registered a 0.11 BAC, did 24 hours’ community service and lost his license for 30 days. Experts say his elevation defies typical DOJ strictness on criminal history. Singh’s push to reconvene grand juries after ‘no bill’ outcomes drew criticism as politically driven over prosecutorial norms. The DOJ lauds him for advancing the ‘America First’ agenda despite internal vetting debates.",

According to four anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr and other officials will also promote investigational leucovorin therapy, based on early trials showing speech and social improvements in autistic children. Previewed by Trump at a Charlie Kirk memorial, the initiative follows federal reviews of Harvard/Mount Sinai studies and highlights internal divisions over communicating unconfirmed environmental risk factors amid claims of an ‘autism epidemic.’",

      "summary": "After Charlie Kirk’s killing, his widow’s rhetoric framed his death as Christian martyrdom, fueling an “accelerationist” narrative. Kirk’s evolution from a secular Tea-Party-era organizer to a Trump-era Christian nationalist paralleled Turning Point USA’s shift from free-market activism to dominionist politics. Turning Point USA, founded in 2012, morphed from a pro-market youth group into a megaphone for charismatic preachers sidelined by the evangelical establishment. Influenced by New Apostolic Reformation theology and the “seven mountains” mandate, he normalized the view that America must be an explicitly Christian nation, fueling a theocratic strain of MAGA conservatism.",

Carrying signs decrying “corporate cowardice” and chanting ���un-American,” participants framed the suspension as a blatant attack on free speech. Parallel demonstrations in New York and Hollywood echoed WGA demands to keep up pressure on Disney until Kimmel returns, decrying this as authoritarian censorship.",

      "summary": "Erika Kirk, widow of late Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk (fatally shot last week), has been named CEO and board chair of the pro-MAGA youth group. The organization says Charlie had designated her successor and framed her appointment as a test of faith and resolve to carry on his mission to “save” the country. Founded in 2012, TPUSA transformed youth politics but faced workplace discrimination claims. Erika holds political science and international relations degrees, a juris master’s, is pursuing a doctorate in Christian leadership, runs faith-based apparel Proclaim Streetwear, and is a former Miss Arizona USA and college basketball player. A memorial is set for Sept. 21 with Trump, Vance, and Rubio.",

Cook, a Biden appointee and first Black woman on the Fed board (term to 2038), denies wrongdoing; lawyers argue the president lacks removal authority. Though too late for this week’s policy meeting—where new governor Stephen Miran dissented for deeper cuts—Trump has publicly demanded interest-rate reductions, challenging Fed autonomy. District Judge Jia Cobb had ruled Trump’s allegations insufficient, prompting the DOJ’s appeal.",
