Under a July agreement tied to the party’s privacy policy, MoU was to hand over funds and data once the party registered with the Electoral Commission on 30 September. After missing a final Friday deadline, insiders say legal action was the last resort. The row risks undermining next month’s Liverpool conference, may force delegate cuts and triggered an ICO probe into an unauthorised membership portal launched on 18 September.",

Earlier Windrush reforms—migrant commissioner role and transformation unit—have not been enacted.

Pochin apologized for what she called “poorly phrased” criticism of DEI-minded advertising but faced sustained backlash as Labour’s Anna Turley and Lib Dem leader Ed Davey denounced her, Labour urged Nigel Farage to intervene, Tory MP Chris Philp reluctantly admitted her comments were wrong, and Pochin later doubled down on X.",

Polanski’s rapid media blitz—61 interviews in two days, a top-10 political podcast, and an 11 million-view social video—has boosted polling to 15% and energized a once fractious coalition. While skeptics warn his eco-populism may alienate rural supporters, activists report unified enthusiasm.

Colleagues warned her language risked bigotry, sparked alarm over unclear indefinite leave to remain (ILR) plans and internal confusion about proposals to strip ILR from benefit claimants or low earners. Labour leader Keir Starmer condemned Lam and Tory policy, while senior ministers including James Cleverly and Kemi Badenoch grappled with mixed messages over oversight and retrospective ILR revocation.",

Reeves is pressing all departments to help tame 4% inflation, warns against a market backlash like 2022’s mini-budget and plans a £2 billion LLP national insurance rise to plug a £40 billion finances gap while maintaining a fiscal buffer for shocks.",

Options include removing VAT and insurance exemptions or excluding luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes, potentially raising £1.2 bn. She’s also pressing ahead with cuts to the health component of universal credit from April 2026. Disability charities and Labour MPs warn of extra burdens on claimants. Reeves must fill a £10–20 bn OBR downgrade with spending cuts and tax rises while shoring up fiscal rules.",

      "summary": "After the Crown Prosecution Service unexpectedly dropped the trial of two British nationals accused of spying for China, Downing Street published three witness statements from deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins. Dating from December 2023 to August 2024, they depict China as an 'epoch-defining challenge' yet signal Labour’s 'three Cs' stance—cooperation, competition and challenge on security. Tories accuse the government of secretly sabotaging the prosecution by refusing to call China an 'enemy', but ministers argue key evidence was compiled under the Conservatives. DPP Stephen Parkinson cited a 5% evidential shortfall under the Official Secrets Act. With both sides disputing motives and political direction, legal and domestic fallout may deepen.",

The August statement warns of “large-scale espionage operations” by China harming UK economic prosperity, democratic integrity and resilience, citing state-linked hacking of the Electoral Commission and MPs’ emails. Conservatives allege political interference and limited disclosure; Starmer asserts failure stems from outdated pre-1911 legislation that Conservatives never updated. Cash denies wrongdoing; Beijing dismisses accusations as a “self-staged anti-China political farce”.",

Finch said the attacker was “wound up” by the parties’ language; Reform’s Zia Yusuf echoed this on X. Farage accused Prime Minister Starmer of inciting violence by branding Reform as unpatriotic. Labour and Green spokespeople denounced harassment, the Greens decried politicisation, and Warwickshire police opened an assault investigation.",

Starmer’s adviser Jonathan Powell, architect of the reset, subsumed the promised China audit into a national security strategy. Despite repeated Chinese cyber and industrial espionage, Labour removed genocide language, excluded China from its Foreign Influence Registration enhanced tier, and prioritizes investment over human rights.",

He described the assault—killing around 1,200 people, taking 251 hostages, and prompting an Israeli offensive with heavy Palestinian casualties—as the worst anti-Jewish atrocity since the Holocaust. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson backed his plea to pause and reflect. Pro-Palestine demonstrations over the weekend led to arrests, and home secretary Shabana Mahmood pledged stronger Public Order Act powers to curb repeated rallies.",

Additional letters debate Labour conference imagery—from Union Jacks replacing red roses to anthem proposals—and warn that without grassroots unity and clear policy shifts, a rightward drift risks ceding ground to Reform UK, especially under proposed proportional representation.",

Mahmood is exploring new curbs on settlement claims from 2021-24’s “Boriswave” visas.",

He cited Jenrick’s prejudicial tweet in a murder trial, Tice’s endorsement of vigilante patrols and Farage’s defence of inflammatory rhetoric as examples of attacks on courts, judges and the Human Rights Act. Speaking at a UCL policy lab event, Hermer argued that rights laws champion everyday justice, condemned rising threats to lawyers, and rejected claims he blocks human-rights reform.",

      "summary": "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage’s proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain would destabilise the NHS by stripping settlement rights from foreign-born doctors and staff—over a third of doctors and one in five NHS workers—triggering exodus, longer waiting lists, ward closures, burnout and eventual privatisation. Danny McCloskey warns this undermines universal care and international solidarity. Correspondents Ian K Watson highlight legal and trade fallout from quitting the ECHR and voiding the EU TCA, Jan Syska and Derek Robinson blame Farage for Brexit-linked migration crises and call on UK parties to challenge his agenda.",

      "summary": "Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has reignited demands to scrap the Conservative-introduced two-child benefit limit, calling it “arbitrary”, unjustifiable and “the worst of Westminster.” Speaking alongside poverty campaigner Terri White, he argued the cap—introduced in 2017—silently punishes low-income families and pushes 109 children into poverty every day. His intervention provoked anger from Labour MPs amid speculation of a return to Westminster and leadership ambitions. Ministers are due to publish a review of the policy this autumn, while charities warn lifting the cap would cost £3.5 bn but lift 470,000 children out of poverty.",

Khan’s office declined to dignify the remarks, noting a 50% jump in US citizenship applications (2,194) in April–June. Starmer, wary of US tariffs, faces growing pressure after Trump’s second state visit.",

Proponents argue this will boost local accountability, integrated community services and cost savings, while critics warn of empowering political rivals and complicating governance.",

It proposes radical measures including abolishing central departments and introducing a Barnett-style funding formula for local budgets. Although Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have already rejected parts of the plan, local government secretary Steve Reed supports deeper devolution as a cost-saving, community-empowering strategy that could undercut Reform UK’s appeal and boost democratic accountability.",

      "summary": "Internal conflict has erupted within the new leftwing party co-founded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana after an unauthorized membership portal began collecting personal data and funds. Corbyn denounced the system as “false,” urged supporters to ignore donation requests and referred the issue to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Sultana countered that she was frozen out “by a sexist boys’ club,” insisting her sole aim was to protect grassroots involvement. Corbyn denied sidelining her. The article closes by inviting readers to share whether this fallout has changed their view of the party and voiced any concerns.",

Owned by director John Richard Simpson via a BVI-linked structure, the firm says the dispute is settled and is now fully compliant. Reform UK confirms it vetted the donor as a permissible UK-registered company. The donation complements major funding from Nick Candy, Zia Yusuf and other high-net-worth backers.",

Corbyn brands the site a “false membership system,” while Sultana accuses a “sexist boys’ club” of sidelining her and centralising control over funds and data. Allies on both sides allege rival factions are vying for power.

Starmer only narrowly avoids humiliation, breathing a sigh of relief as he survives Trump’s ego-driven spectacle.",

Their personality-driven split, highlighting the challenges of launching a new party under the UK’s first-past-the-post system and exposing divides between traditional Corbynists and Gaza-focused independents, underscores the fragmentation of Britain’s left and leaves 700,000 registered supporters politically homeless.
