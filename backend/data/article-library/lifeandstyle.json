To treat, gently wipe foliage, then spray with pesticide weekly to break the life cycle; for prized specimens introduce biological controls like predatory mites (Amblyseius cucumeris). Prevent recurrence by boosting humidity, quarantining outdoor plants for 14 days before bringing them indoors, inspecting new growth—especially undersides—and maintaining vigilance to detect and address thrips early.",

Professor Adam Taylor advises there’s no cure; prevention relies on moderation—alternating drinks with water and staying within weekly guidelines. Once symptoms begin, only time, rehydration and paracetamol ease the headache and grogginess. Awareness of these age-related physiological shifts explains why older adults often suffer harsher aftereffects.",

After an optimistic childhood in Arkholme, she trained at LIPA, where a tutor’s demand that she lose 10 stone only strengthened her resolve to own her body and talent. Webb’s early credits included Plebs, White Gold and The Split, but her breakthrough came as Theodora in Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You (2020). She now stars as Shannon in Channel 4’s Big Boys and Kirsty in Sky’s Mr Bigstuff, drawing inspiration from Coel, Danny Dyer and Ryan Sampson, and embracing a ‘provocatively kind’ persona and unshakeable self-belief.",

      "summary": "Yawning, seen across vertebrates, was long thought to boost oxygen but studies disprove this. Instead, jaw gaping and deep inhalation stretch blood vessels, increasing arterial flow and venous return in the skull, and inhaled air cools brain tissue. Thermoregulation theory explains why moderate warmth raises yawn frequency and why some conditions trigger excess yawning. The arousal-change hypothesis suggests yawns help switch between brain states and may circulate cerebrospinal fluid. Contagious yawning likely arises from mirror neurons or aids group coordination by synchronizing alertness. Evolved functions may overlap—brain cooling, circulatory adjustment and alertness shifts—and continual yawning thus supports optimal brain function.",

Ken fell 800ft unhurt but Jean broke her spine, pelvis, tailbone and suffered internal bleeding and gangrenous wounds. Trapped by blizzard, she spent three nights in a cramped tent vowing to live, then embarked on a five-day descent—sometimes crawling—while Ken carried gear until they reached help. Told she’d never hike again, she defied odds: recovered, trekked the Himalayas, founded Nepal tours, endured chronic pain through meditation, and finally forgave herself.",

Her unexpected kindness story highlights mutual support and the ripple effect of small acts in everyday life.",

Encourage questions, model balanced news consumption, set media boundaries (time limits, no devices in bedrooms) and develop family media plans. Teach critical media literacy—fact-checking via reputable outlets—reinforce democratic norms, avoid background news noise and share supportive rituals like letter-writing or volunteering to bolster coping skills.",

Height plateaus at 30–35 before gradual shrinkage as vertebral discs lose water and cancellous bone condenses. Men and women also stoop to shift their center of gravity.

Snoring arises from partial airway obstruction—soft palate, throat or epiglottis—when relaxed muscles collapse under gravity. Risk factors include alcohol, excess weight, allergies, nasal polyps, deviated septum or colds. Female hormones (oestrogen, progesterone) help tone airway muscles, but shifts in hormone levels and gestational weight gain increase women’s snoring. Women underreport their snoring due to stigma.

After burnout, she embraced Vedanta philosophy and daily meditation, shaping a conscious approach to business. For Portas, true success lies in family moments and authentic human connections.

      "summary": "Craig Silvey, acclaimed author of Jasper Jones, reflects on life as a devoted father of three—toddler Matilda and newborn twins Hazel and Stella—while promoting his new middle-grade sequel, Runt and the Diabolical Dognapping. Based in Fremantle after a childhood on a Dwellingup apple orchard, he credits the work ethic of rural men and the influence of his grandmother and great-aunt for shaping his storytelling. Silvey argues fiction can challenge toxic masculinity by offering boys positive, empathetic role models and validating their inner worlds. Between baby wrangling and film development, he’s recalibrating the meaning of family and preparing future novels.",

Aim for 70–80% of your 1RM for 8–12 reps, using progressive overload and allowing recovery. Beginners can start on machines or free weights, with coach check-ins. Creatine offers modest performance gains. Structure workouts as full-body twice a week or split by muscle groups. Fuel workouts with balanced meals and 20–30g protein per post-session meal.",

Inspired by Paul Mescal and a gym-centric “body as flex” culture, these styles bare navels and quads while balancing baggy trousers. Observers hail a broader queering of menswear and note reduced fabric use—though fast-fashion churn persists.",

Drawing on her toddler’s potty training and her own psychoanalysis, she shows how applying pressure collapses progress. Instead, real change unfolds gradually, requiring tolerance of being a beginner, letting go of control, and embracing internal exploration. Therapist-patient work succeeds when pressure is held and examined, not relieved by instant fixes. Sarner finds this process grounding, more fulfilling and resistant to cancel culture and swipe culture. It offers realistic hope rooted in ordinary reality.",

Engaging vision, memory, and association areas keeps vessel walls flexible, counteracting genetic risks, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and poor diet. Additionally, the sense of achievement and social interaction from puzzles improves well-being and reduces loneliness—factors linked to age-related cognitive decline. Combined with regular exercise, a healthy diet, and group activities, puzzles help maintain brain function, though they can’t override genetic predisposition. Similar benefits arise from walking with friends, dance classes, and museum visits.",

      "summary": "Living in a 1920s Queenslander in Brisbane, the author overcomes a long-held terror of snakes after discovering eastern carpet pythons nesting in her ceiling. By naming the first visitor Sylvia and observing her graceful jaw movements, tongue flicks and shedding cycle, she comes to admire their beauty and intelligence. Subsequent pythons—including the aggressive “Shitty” and the juvenile “Slinky”—reinforce lessons of individual personality, wild-animal respect and ecological benefits such as rodent control.",

They probe how toys respond to children, affirm emotions, share conversations with parents or third parties, and convey social cues. They warn £74 AI companions may widen the digital divide—privileged kids gain supervised AI exposure and literacy while low-income families face unregulated risks—and urge public dialogue to inform parents and policymakers.",

Raquel, disgusted by toothpaste foam in her cooking space and direct tap contact, insists Gina confine oral care to the bathroom sink and use a cup. Gina, who has ADHD, argues that multitasking routines, sink rinsing and shared plumbing make it harmless, and that Raquel’s demands unfairly single her out. Guardian readers largely side with Raquel on hygiene and shared-space etiquette, urging Gina to accommodate her flatmate’s comfort. An online poll invites readers to decide if Gina must clean up her act.",

Owners treat pets as family—buy presents, cook meals, leave on TV/radio, even take them on holidays—driving $21.3 bn in annual spending, half on food. Human names like Harry, Lucy and Daisy top lists; food monikers (Taco, Oreo) rise. Labradors, goldens, German shepherds and border collies lead purebreds, while groodles (poodle–golden crosses) spearhead designer breeds. Yet 33% of dog owners skip daily walks and rising vet costs force some to delay care. Based on 2,450 respondents, results were weighted to census data.",
