      "summary": "Moya Sarner’s final How to build a better life column reflects on the healing power of endings, urging readers to stay present rather than avoid difficult farewells. She argues that therapy endings offer a vital space for mourning unmet needs and confronting abandonment, and recounts her own experience when her father died while her infant daughter slept beside him in a hospice courtyard. Confronting his death—prompted by a psychoanalyst’s truth—allowed intimate moments of grief, gratitude and growth. Sarner champions psychodynamic psychotherapy in the NHS as a way to ‘stay in the room’, face endings and truly live.",

      "summary": "Food poisoning occurs when you ingest food contaminated with bacteria or toxins. Some pathogens (eg Bacillus cereus in reheated rice) produce toxins pre-ingestion, causing rapid vomiting; others (Salmonella, E coli, Campylobacter) trigger gut inflammation and diarrhoea later. Antibiotics are rarely prescribed without exact diagnosis, as they can worsen toxin-mediated illness. To prevent infection, avoid raw oysters and undercooked meat, sear all exposed beef, never wash chicken, refrigerate cooked food within two hours, use separate utensils, a meat thermometer and wash hands thoroughly. If ill, prioritise rehydration with oral salts and a BRAT diet; seek medical help for severe dehydration, sepsis signs or lingering symptoms like IBS.",

Now estimated at £10,000–£20,000 for a 3 December auction, the find offered emotional closure and will fund a contemporary artwork purchase.",

Cheaper, less-invasive techniques, buy-now-pay-later plans and celebrity transparency fuel “aesthetic inflation.” Yet rhytidectomy risks—hematoma, nerve damage, scarring, even death—and 50% rate of post-op depression or anxiety, plus $8,500–$200,000 costs, reinforce that a facelift doesn’t solve ageism, classism or real psychological needs.

While increased exercise generates heat that triggers sweat for thermoregulation, environmental factors (temperature, humidity), clothing choice, and individual traits (fitness, age, sex, body size, climate acclimatisation) significantly affect sweat volume. Consequently, you can sweat profusely during light exercise in high humidity or barely at all during intense cold-weather workouts. Appearance can deceive: a drenched shirt doesn’t always equal maximum effort and minimal sweat doesn’t imply a light workout. Instead, monitor breathing rate, perceived exertion, or heart rate for effort. However, heavy sweating remains a useful dehydration warning—hydrate accordingly.",

After stress fractures and microaggressions about race and nationality, he reinvented himself as Nitro on Gladiators, a Strictly Come Dancing contender and broadcaster. Now a father, he credits family values, mental resilience and community bonds for his journey.",

Sheffield Addictions Research Group data show no/low beer is 5% pricier in shops and 25% in pubs; cider 9–10% higher; 0% wine and some supermarket spirits can be cheaper. Premium branding, small-batch production, R&D, complex de-alcoholisation processes and pack-size promotions skew average prices. Brands like Pentire and Botivo charge £27–28 for artisanal spirits, reflecting lengthy distillation. Price barriers risk excluding lower-income consumers and widening alcohol-related health inequalities.",

Sarner recounts her agonising waits for exam results, pregnancy interventions, and divergent medical advice during her third trimester to illustrate how tolerating ambiguity is crucial.

His polyester cape snagged on a bannister but the Velcro gave way, and a neighbor caught it. Inside, amid heat and smoke, he found and cradled an unconscious intruder—who’d broken in—carrying him outside and reviving him with sternum rubs. The grateful trespasser later fled yet acknowledged owing his life. The rescuer joked about Homelander’s irony, retrieved his cape, returned to the party, and was later awarded a Carnegie medal and Ohio Fire Service Hall of Fame induction.",

After her first trick-or-treaters left her puzzled wholemeal crackers, she resisted pumpkin carvings in humid summers. The pandemic lockdown ended with a streetwide Halloween party—sanitiser atop letterboxes, treats lowered by fishing rods—sparked her conversion. Now every October, her suburb maps trick-or-treat routes, inflatables and DIY scares appear, and families revel in the rare communal magic of Halloween night.",

Instead, jaw gaping and deep inhalation stretch blood vessels, increasing arterial flow and venous return in the skull, and inhaled air cools brain tissue.

The arousal-change hypothesis suggests yawns help switch between brain states and may circulate cerebrospinal fluid.

Psychotherapist Ali Ross traces the compulsion to childhood politeness that has morphed into self-sabotage and recommends a relational humanist approach. By focusing on self-compassion and ‘being’ rather than endless problem-solving, she can learn to pause before speaking, count to ten or replace “I’m sorry” with neutral phrases like “I see,” interrupting shame-driven reflexes and building genuine confidence.",

Height plateaus at 30–35 before gradual shrinkage as vertebral discs lose water and cancellous bone condenses. Men and women also stoop to shift their center of gravity.

Experts recommend writing down worst-case predictions and tracking outcomes, embracing uncertainty by acknowledging what you don’t know, daily logging three wins, compiling a sprawling achievement CV, learning to accept compliments, and reframing failures as growth. Identify your transferable “secret sauce” to connect past successes to new contexts.

He argues these invasive procedures inflict unnecessary pain, violate animal welfare, and exemplify outdated human customs unjustly overriding the ponies’ quality of life. He recalls reading the Guardian’s Country Diary praising the forest’s heritage but questions how such cruelty remains acceptable. Rose demands an end to these rites and recognition of the ponies as sentient animals deserving respect.",

Snoring arises from partial airway obstruction—soft palate, throat or epiglottis—when relaxed muscles collapse under gravity. Risk factors include alcohol, excess weight, allergies, nasal polyps, deviated septum or colds. Female hormones (oestrogen, progesterone) help tone airway muscles, but shifts in hormone levels and gestational weight gain increase women’s snoring. Women underreport their snoring due to stigma. New or worsening snoring can signal sleep apnoea; loud, disruptive snoring merits medical evaluation.",

      "summary": "A close, long-standing bond between you and your cousin’s daughter—from bridesmaid duties to a sponsored gap year—left you feeling rejected when she held an intimate wedding without you, only sharing photos afterward. You’re hurt after years of support, interpreting her omission as ingratitude. Annalisa Barbieri, citing psychotherapist Chris Mills, explains that differing values and life stages often lead to unintentional slights rather than deliberate exclusion. Your cousin’s daughter likely values you but chose a small celebration for budget or personal reasons. This could mark a shift toward a more equal, adult relationship, with future gatherings offering fresh opportunities to reconnect.",

Instead, real change unfolds gradually, requiring tolerance of being a beginner, letting go of control, and embracing internal exploration. Therapist-patient work succeeds when pressure is held and examined, not relieved by instant fixes. Sarner finds this process grounding, more fulfilling and resistant to cancel culture and swipe culture. It offers realistic hope rooted in ordinary reality.",

Although still not a natural morning person, she avoids last-minute scrambles, cultivates daily momentum and feels more in control of her life.",

      "summary": "Roxi Carare, professor of neuroanatomy, clarifies that puzzles don’t prevent dementia but can delay symptom onset by stimulating blood flow and waste clearance in the brain. Engaging vision, memory, and association areas keeps vessel walls flexible, counteracting genetic risks, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and poor diet. Additionally, the sense of achievement and social interaction from puzzles improves well-being and reduces loneliness—factors linked to age-related cognitive decline. Combined with regular exercise, a healthy diet, and group activities, puzzles help maintain brain function, though they can’t override genetic predisposition. Similar benefits arise from walking with friends, dance classes, and museum visits.",
