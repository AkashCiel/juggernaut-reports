The outlet will again attend public events and receive press releases. The ban, partly eased earlier for BBC-funded local democracy reporters, had drawn condemnation from Keir Starmer and local MPs. Editor Natalie Fahy called the reversal a victory for press freedom, though Barton’s interview availability remains unclear.",

      "summary": "On Sept 10, Israeli airstrikes struck a Sana’a newspaper complex housing three Houthi-linked outlets, killing 31 journalists and media staff (35 people including a child) and wounding 131—the deadliest attack on media workers since the 2009 Maguindanao massacre, the Committee to Protect Journalists says. Staff were completing the weekly print edition when hit. Israel said it targeted Houthi military PR in retaliation for missile and Red Sea attacks. CPJ warns this follows a pattern since Oct 7, 2023, with Israeli forces killing 247 journalists in Gaza and Lebanon, often labeling them combatants, risking impunity and breaching international law.",

Born in north London, she studied English and politics at Swansea, reported for the Camden New Journal, worked as a reproductive rights press officer and freelanced for Nursing Times. A cellist, pianist and poet with a lifelong passion for politics and the arts, she completed counselling training in 2018.
