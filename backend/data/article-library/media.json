Conducted by Great Place to Work, the survey nonetheless certified Fox as a top workplace that year. Staff urged new ethical guidelines, more hard-news focus and distancing from hosts like Carlson and Hannity. One staffer said they’d “sold their soul to the devil” and often left in tears.

      "summary": "Armando Iannucci, creator of Veep, is facing funding challenges for an untitled TV or film project based on Donald Trump’s speeches, as US buyers fear political retribution and legal harassment under a potential second Trump administration. At a Creative UK event he cited warnings of IRS scrutiny and tariff threats, so he’s exploring non-US backers. The project’s format remains undecided. Iannucci, known for The Death of Stalin, underscores free-speech concerns amid Trump’s threats and a Writers Guild warning against censorship. He also recalled Trump’s cease-and-desist letter over last year’s Apprentice drama, which still earned two Oscar nominations, highlighting industry defamation tensions.",

      "summary": "Disney-owned ABC indefinitely suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live! after Kimmel accused Republicans of exploiting Charlie Kirk’s killing, echoing Nexstar and Sinclair’s decision to drop the show while pursuing FCC approval for multibillion-dollar acquisitions (Tegna, Paramount-Skydance) under Trump-appointed chair Brendan Carr. CBS’s Stephen Colbert faced a similar cancellation ahead of the $8.4bn Paramount-Skydance merger. Analysts warn Trump’s FCC wields licensing leverage to enforce a right-wing editorial line, and his lawsuits against the New York Times and pressure on outlets like the Washington Post and WSJ highlight shrinking media plurality.",

      "summary": "In July Trump signed off on rescinding $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, slashing CPB support for 1,500 stations. Thirty-six tribal radio outlets—among them Koahnic Broadcast Corporation (KNBA) in Alaska—stand to lose over $9.4 million a year; Koahnic alone faces an $825,000 shortfall. Native stations, vital for weather and missing-persons alerts, language programs and local news, now brace for layoffs or closure. Stations have raised emergency funds—KNBA secured $82,000 in four days, Alaska Community Foundation has $3.5 million of a $15 million goal—and partnered on long-term grants. Leaders warn cuts will be “devastating and catastrophic,” threatening essential rural Indigenous services.",

      "summary": "The BBC and fellow PSBs (S4C, STV, Alba) have united to demand regulations compelling platforms like YouTube to grant their impartial public service content greater prominence and fairer revenue shares, warning that algorithm-driven neglect fuels misinformation. Ofcom signals readiness to enforce such rules as broadcasters’ finances suffer with ad revenue migrating to YouTube and TikTok and licence fee payers falling. YouTube is now the UK’s second-most watched service, particularly among Gen Alpha. ITV and Channel 4 chiefs call for binding regulation or equitable commercial deals to protect trusted journalism and the UK’s social fabric.",

Court documents outline alleged offences—kissing, stroking, rubbing and undressing—at his Sydney home, restaurants in Kiama and Mosman, the Sydney Opera House and public events. His lawyer won an eight-week adjournment over disclosure and leak concerns, with a local court trial now scheduled for 2026, expected to last six weeks to five months.

ABC retains accreditation for the Chequers lunch and White House briefings. Lyons, who faced Trump’s ire over questions on his business dealings, is backed by the broadcaster and Australian politicians. UK officials said when the conference was moved indoors, capacity was cut and ten of 15 overseas journalists, including ABC, were reassigned. Downing Street blamed high demand, not politics.",
