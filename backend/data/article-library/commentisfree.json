      "summary": "After multiple lethal police interventions in mental health crises—like the tasering and death of 95-year-old Clare Nowland—experts and families are calling for alternative first responders. A 2024 NSW review found police often escalate such incidents, recording one mental health call every nine minutes. Community-led programs—from the Peacemaker mediators on Groote Eylandt to Fitzroy Crossing’s Night Place and Long Beach’s crisis teams—demonstrate that unarmed, specialist responders reduce harm, de-escalate tension and cut offending. The National Justice Project urges a “180-degree shift” toward funded, community-based care, legal reform and separation of public health from policing to save lives.",

Liew argues anti-urbanism fuels populist, white supremacist agendas, recasting cities as violent, seditious spaces to simplify complex social change.

Reacting to an Ontario TV ad quoting Reagan’s 1987 warning on trade wars, Trump slapped an extra 10% tariff on Canada and accused it of influencing the Supreme Court ahead of Trump v VOS, which challenges his use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. Two lower courts deemed his measures unlawful, and amicus briefs from conservative lawyers pile against him. Facing a Nov. 5 hearing, Trump vows to attend in person to intimidate justices. His erratic tariffs have fractured Republicans, hit US GDP forecasts, and revived debate on separation of powers and protectionism.",

Campaigners demand a windfall levy on bank profits; gambling firms decry higher duties; estate agents and landlords resist home and NI reforms; supermarkets and pension funds threaten price hikes and industry damage. With no popular path to raise universal taxes, Toynbee urges the chancellor to ignore both lobbyists and fickle public opinion and pursue fair, long-term measures soon.",

From classics like Nosferatu’s “arthritic” hands to modern prosthetic approaches in Longlegs and Midsommar, films other disabled bodies as monsters. Underrepresented, disabled creatives account for just 2% of the industry. Bromwich calls for more authentic representation driven by disabled writers, directors and actors: “Nothing about us without us.”",

Unlike past figures such as Blair, Brown or Osborne who fought publicly for policies, today’s Labour frontbench fears confrontation, leaving voters uninformed and opponents ready to exploit every vacuum.",

After a powerful car bomb targeting Rai investigative journalist Sigfrido Ranucci prompted comparisons with 1980s terror, Meloni voiced solidarity but her right-wing coalition has sued reporters, pressured state media and resisted defamation reforms. EU bodies have flagged threats to public-media independence, while Ranucci faced a parliamentary grilling over an exposé on the Senate president’s neo-fascist past. Vexatious litigation and political interference now threaten hard-hitting investigative shows, while Italy slides down global press-freedom rankings.",

      "summary": "Javier Milei’s midterm victory in Argentina was propelled by Donald Trump’s ideological intervention: a $20 billion US currency swap line, direct peso purchases and public endorsements. Mirroring 1946’s Spruille Braden campaign against Perón, Washington aims to bolster an anti-Perónist ally and signal rewards for loyalty across Latin America. Milei’s radical austerity—steep subsidy cuts, surging inflation and real-wage declines—has already eroded public confidence, and US funding is only a temporary lifeline. With a slim congressional minority protecting his agenda, Milei now faces the daunting task of stabilizing the currency and restoring voter faith, all under volatile US influence.",

Donegan rebuts the first critique—Republicans already gerrymander unilaterally—and concedes the second’s democratic costs but argues these trade-offs are essential to blunt Trump’s executive overreach.

Yet Washington has no clear plan for Gaza’s reconstruction, the composition or timeline of an international security force or the disarmament of Hamas. Israeli media largely omit civilian casualties, fueling hardline sentiment. Schwartz argues that beyond babysitting the truce, US emissaries must now present concrete governance, security and humanitarian strategies to avert another escalation.",

Tracing horror’s lineage from German expressionism and 1980s vampire booms to Jordan Peele’s Get Out, it shows how ‘elevated horror’—a cheaper, experimental medium—tackles race, class and gender, attracting women filmmakers.

      "summary": "An editorial in The Guardian warns that between 2019 and 2024 small UK music venues and festivals have sharply declined—125 grassroots venues lost in 2023 and 161 festivals closed—while arena tours and stadium shows pocket record revenues (£1.63 billion in 2023). Backed by the Music Venue Trust and MPs, a voluntary £1 ticket levy on major venues would redistribute funds to sustain local clubs, community-owned sites and nurture new talent. The scheme, complemented by public investment, addresses venue closures, reduced music education, ticket inflation and industry concentration in ticketing giants Live Nation and AEG, aiming to rebalance Britain’s live-music ecosystem.",

Mullin argues this commitment doomed Labour, echoing past errors like Wilson’s delayed devaluation, and that an honest tax discussion is essential for sustainable funding.",

      "summary": "Rediscovered by Persephone Books, Sally Carson’s 1934 novel Crooked Cross charts the six months from December 1932 to summer 1933 in the fictional Bavarian town of Kranach, following the Kluger family’s Christmas reunion as Hitler’s influence grows. Through domestic detail—party games, Helmy’s portrait of Hitler—and mounting horrors at Dachau, Carson diagnoses how economic collapse and a search for purpose drew moderate Germans toward Nazism. Her immediate, morally urgent narrative, written as events unfolded, resonates in 2025 as a cautionary tale about the seductions of extremism and the necessity of clear-eyed resistance.",

By stacking courts, pardoning January 6 rioters, ignoring judicial restraints and pushing prosecutions of critics such as John Bolton, Letitia James and James Comey, Trump seeks vengeance via the justice system. Experts warn of “competitive authoritarianism” as undermining democracy. With No Kings protests looming, the administration casts dissent as disorder, while a survey finds a third of Republicans support deporting opponents.

Behr warns Keir Starmer that Britain’s Labour could repeat Macron’s error: captured centre-ground mandates without durable coalitions risk isolation and empower populists, producing frenetic disorder with no lasting reform or legacy.",

      "summary": "The Guardian editorial highlights the twofold human cost of the multibillion-dollar online scam industry: consumers bilked by “pig-butchering” frauds and trafficked workers forced into modern-slavery cybercrime compounds. Research shows over 200,000 people coerced into operations across Southeast Asia and beyond, enduring torture, debt bondage, and constant surveillance. Criminal syndicates leverage satellite internet, deepfake technology and corrupt officials to evade crackdowns and shift locations. The piece calls for international intelligence sharing, tech-platform accountability, strengthened civil society partnerships, and crucially, protection for coerced scammers from prosecution.",

She describes Warhol-style portraits hanging in party HQ, branded Toby jugs and whisky, glass-cased outfits and cardboard cutouts at conference, plus a fan-made mosaic. References to leadership contenders dressing as Thatcher or invoking her image feel less tribute than a faith-like project to relive 1979. Williams argues this obsessive merchandising and shrine culture betray Thatcher’s pragmatic legacy and questions whether the Iron Lady would have endorsed such devotion.",

      "summary": "Guardian columnist John Harris warns that austerity and cultural bias have erased Britain’s youth clubs—vital ‘warm, welcoming’ spaces offering social support, creative outlets and safe connections. Since 2010 local funding plunged 70%, shuttering 1,200 centres and laying off 4,500 youth workers, despite evidence youth clubs reduce crime, improve education and combat loneliness and polarisation. Emma Warren’s new book traces 150 years of state and voluntary provision, while surveys show 93% of attendees gain positive impact. Harris argues Conservatives once championed youth services; modern politicians must restore these community anchors to heal social divisions.",

Never-before-seen archives reveal CBS presidents, like Arthur Taylor, pressing editors to favor pro-business coverage and curb muckraking. Early collaborators—Roger Ailes, Metromedia and tobacco executives—engineered rightwing media, from repealing the fairness doctrine to modern tech-driven consolidation. Today Weiss shields oligarch interests amid algorithmic suppression, media mergers and defunding of public outlets. The authors argue this entrenched media monopoly endangers democracy by silencing accountability journalism.",

      "summary": "In England homeschooling notifications doubled since 2020 to 66,000 in 2024 (total ~111,700 students). Once fringe and religious/health-driven, it now attracts parents seeking flexible timetables and well-being days. Families craft “concentrated learning” weeks, combining core lessons with extracurriculars, clubs and social meet-ups. Socialisation remains via orchestra, sports or youth theatre rather than classes. Self-motivated teens use textbooks, YouTube and tutors to excel, some returning to school for A-levels. Critics worry about curriculum gaps and family strain, but advocates highlight reduced stress, holidays in term time and better suit for children who “don’t fit the mould”.",

She argues such persistent errors signal deliberate othering of ethnic names, echoing past mispronunciations of Kamala Harris by David Perdue and Donald Trump. Mahdawi notes young children effortlessly pronounce “Mahdawi” and “Mamdani,” underscoring politicians’ disrespect and the need to stop intentional mispronunciations.",

Badenoch’s mimicry of Farage—promising to leave the ECHR, scrap the Climate Change Act and create an ICE-style removals force—alienates moderate and younger Tories, risks deepening divisions and handing seats to Labour or Reform UK. Traditional conservatives like Heseltine, Grieve and new activists such as Cody Butler seek a pragmatic, pro-Europe, pro-business platform to restore competence and social liberalism. Without this, Toynbee warns, the Tory party faces self-destruction under populist extremism.",

      "summary": "As Tory conference opens in Manchester, Nesrine Malik argues the Conservative party’s 14 years of culture wars, Brexit-fuelled jingoism and punitive immigration policies laid the groundwork for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. What remains of the Tories has morphed, not died: their normalisation of separatism, anti-immigrant rhetoric and spectacle politics created a more extreme heir free from traditional Tory constraints. Economic stagnation among younger voters drove Conservatives toward culture-war diversions, undermining their governing ideology. Kemi Badenoch’s provocative pledges on net zero, CRT and an ICE-style removals force exemplify this legacy. Rather than lament Reform’s rise, Badenoch should “rejoice” in her party’s inheritance of the Tories’ efforts.",

Keir Starmer’s strategy of playing up Nigel Farage’s threat and tolerating Kemi Badenoch in the Tory ranks could help Labour. Jenkins criticizes Starmer’s timidity on Brexit and migration. He forecasts Reform falling below 25% and Starmer in Downing Street by 2029, while conferences remain pandemonium.",

In contrast, Labour’s Ed Miliband defends net zero as an economic and moral mission, rejecting trickle-down and austerity, promising unionised green jobs, lower bills and a fairer social democracy.",

She imagines visits to a free-economic zone in Djibouti, US urban markets rigged by unregulated labour, and local Vauxhall skyscrapers as concrete monuments to property speculation and political captivation. Ultimately she realises the class is actually heading to Dorset’s coastline for erosion and landform studies, underscoring the contrast between academic abstraction of neoliberal theory and the concrete landscapes students explore.",

A crippling blockade, sewage collapse and chemical contamination ensure famine and environmental collapse. Bombing debris laced with toxic metals and white phosphorus adds lasting harm, while staggering war emissions foreclose recovery. Monbiot warns this “holocide” seeks to erase Palestinians and their homeland, breaching the Rome Statute.",

Drawing on his experience with Denis Healey and examples like Attlee, Beckett’s interim leadership and the Healey–Benn clash, he calls on Labour to abolish the post via a “none-of-the-above” option to preserve unity and efficiency.",

Conditioned to people-please, she recounts her cleaning job: over-treating dogs was easy but unkind; real kindness meant proper training. She contrasts superficial niceness—praising a flawed speech or ignoring lice notices—to true kindness: honest critique and diligent hair checks. Embracing kindness freed her to set boundaries, offer constructive feedback and improve her work and well-being.",

Britain’s record—endorsing Israel’s cutting of Gaza’s power and water, rejecting a ceasefire, banning pro-Palestine protests and continuing lucrative arms exports—has been timid and reactive. Framing recognition with impossible Israeli preconditions dilutes its impact. To make recognition meaningful, the UK must impose sanctions, trade embargoes and diplomatic isolation to halt the unfolding genocide, annexation and ethnic cleansing.",

The sweeping diplomatic shift is symbolic, hindered by the US blocking UN membership and domestic political calculations. Israel faces growing isolation as evidence of genocide mounts; Palestinians endure looming annexation and displacement.

Despite Sir Keir Starmer’s praise for a tech memorandum promising US investment and AI collaboration, UK tariffs remain unchanged, and billions pledged pale against global spending. The visit showcased pageantry—from golden carriages to bespoke red boxes—while protests and arrests under the Malicious Communications Act highlighted domestic unease. Trump’s reluctance on Russia, calls for more fossil fuel extraction, and migration militarization underscored policy divergence. Britain’s deference, the editorial warns, risks reducing it to a technological vassal, trading impact for symbolism.",
