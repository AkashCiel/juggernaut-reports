      "summary": "UK rejected robust atrocity prevention plans for Sudan despite warnings of genocidal ethnic cleansing in El Fasher, choosing its “least ambitious” of four FCDO options amid aid cuts. An internal paper cited resource and staffing constraints, limiting additional funding to £10m via ICRC and partners rather than a comprehensive protection mechanism. After RSF forces seized El Fasher in October 2025, mass killings, rapes and thousands missing exposed the failure of this minimalist approach. An ICAI review condemned cuts that stalled conflict-related sexual violence programmes and delayed women’s protection until 2026. Critics say the decision undermines the UK’s UN penholder role and risks complicity in Darfur’s ongoing genocide despite £120m pledged aid.",

Infrastructure upgrades, armed forces at historic sites and new companies like Citalá Resources underscore fears of reactivation. NGOs face surveillance, politically charged trials and a 30% foreign-donations tax, while rural communities confront acute water scarcity (<1,800 m³ per capita) and arsenic risk. Opponents fear renewed contamination, violence and threats to cultural identity.",

Qualified female teachers are sacked and replaced by teenage madrasa graduates; curricula focus solely on Quran memorization, Taliban law and gender roles in Pashto, with no maths or science. International aid and school supplies are diverted. Girls drop out of public schools, and madrasa certificates become the only recognized qualification, erasing career ambitions.",

      "summary": "Trinidad and Tobago’s oil output has plunged from 278,000 barrels a day in the 1970s to under 54,000 today, driving a 48% drop in energy revenues to $14.7 bn, while non-energy receipts rose 26% to $32.7 bn. High public debt (64.5% of GDP), low growth (1.7% in 2024) and shrinking gas reserves (around ten years at current rates) force a choice between deep-water drilling deals with ExxonMobil (potential $21.7 bn investment) and nascent green strategies: 4 m tonnes of green hydrogen and 57 GW offshore wind by 2065. Economists warn that without diversification into tourism, agriculture, finance and renewables, the country risks ecological harm, climate shocks and faltering social gains.",

      "summary": "The Turkana Health and Genomics Project sequenced 367 whole genomes and analyzed over 7 million variants in Kenya’s Turkana pastoralists, identifying eight regions under positive selection—most notably the kidney-expressed gene STC1, linked to dehydration resilience and purine metabolism on their meat-rich diet. Adaptations dating to aridification 5,000 years ago explain low gout incidence despite high purine intake and 90% dehydration rates. However, urban migrants show altered gene expression predisposing them to hypertension and obesity. Co-produced with community elders, the study offers insights for tailored health programs and climate-driven human evolution.",

These unique Hadrami structures, infused with southeast Asian motifs, anchor Tarim’s Sufi and missionary heritage, recognised by ICESCO in 2010 and on Yemen’s Unesco tentative list. Cash-strapped antiquities officials can only document dilapidation, lacking resources to save these endangered monuments.",

UK aid to Ghana fell from £47.1 m in 2019 to £13.9 m in 2023 amid reprioritisation toward Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza. Chapman touted successes such as a HMRC tax partnership yielding £100 m annually, biotech grants and Global Fund health support, while conceding “less money for traditional programming” and facing widespread criticism.",
