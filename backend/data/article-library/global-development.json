Despite political goodwill, unpaid claims have soared past ₹1tn (₹4bn pending in Kerala alone), delaying reimbursements 4–6+ months, straining hospital cashflows, and causing tax liabilities. Fraud scrutiny and cumbersome paperwork exacerbate delays, leading some states (e.g. Haryana) to suspend coverage. Critics warn that without timely, inflation-adjusted payments, Modi’s flagship scheme risks collapse.",

Three projects regained USAID support; nine could not be saved. Example: Alima’s malnutrition, maternity and vaccination services in Mali.",

Adaptations dating to aridification 5,000 years ago explain low gout incidence despite high purine intake and 90% dehydration rates. However, urban migrants show altered gene expression predisposing them to hypertension and obesity.
