A mother from Northumberland welcomes relief that courts will no longer back abusive fathers or discredited “parental alienation” claims, citing past trauma and lost custody. A Bristol father warns caring dads may now face prohibitive costs and delays securing time with their children. A Calgary correspondent highlights Canada’s 30-year child-centric model, upholding children’s rights above parental claims.",

      "summary": "The High Court overturned a “dangerously outdated” family court decision that domestic abuse between parents wouldn’t likely harm their children. The mother alleged seven rapes (2009–2020), stalking, revenge-porn threats and an attempted murder by brake-pad removal; the father, on police bail with a CPS charging decision pending, denies all claims and alleges parental alienation. Recorder Forshaw KC had refused a fact-finding hearing, deeming the abuse “historical” and irrelevant to child risk. Mr Justice Garrido KC quashed this “wrong turn,” ordering a hearing and warning these disputes go to the heart of child welfare. A report finds abuse in 87% of family cases but cited in only 42% of welfare rulings, fueling calls by Women’s Aid for mandatory judicial training.",

Where conception by rape wasn’t established criminally, crown courts must notify local authorities to seek the mother’s consent for proceedings. Bolsover MP Natalie Fleet, drawing on her own experience of rape, campaigned successfully for this reform, supported by Deputy PM David Lammy and minister Alex Davies-Jones, as part of measures to protect survivors and children and overhaul family-law presumptions.",

Higgins and Sharaz have filed an appeal. The case ties back to Higgins’ 2021 sexual assault allegations against a colleague in Reynolds’ office, with related defamation rulings and appeals involving Bruce Lehrmann ongoing.",

      "summary": "Under a new sentencing bill in England and Wales, probation officers would gain legal powers to photograph and publish names and images of offenders completing unpaid community work (‘community payback’), aiming to boost public confidence in non-custodial sentences. Critics—including probation inspectors, union leaders and charities—warn the measures risk humiliating offenders’ families, deterring participation, hampering rehabilitation and exacerbating marginalisation. The government says the policy will increase transparency as unpaid work orders expand to alleviate prison overcrowding, with exemptions for vulnerable individuals to be defined in subsequent legislation.",

A persuasive orator and mentor, he trained judges under the Human Rights Act, advised parliament and was appointed honorary QC in 2020. Renowned for wit and principle, he died suddenly aged 67.",
