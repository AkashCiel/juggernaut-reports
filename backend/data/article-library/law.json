      "summary": "Justice secretary David Lammy’s reforms would bar jury trials for offences carrying sentences up to three years, introduce judge-only “swift courts” and boost magistrates’ sentencing powers from 12 to 18 months to halve jury trials and clear an 80,000-case backlog. Fierce opposition from MPs, peers and senior lawyers has prompted officials to consider reverting to Brian Leveson’s model—two lay magistrates alongside judges and a two-year threshold—to avoid a bruising Lords battle. Ministers are confident of Commons approval but wary of another high-profile U-turn.",

In his first comments since Britain’s muted response to the US attack on Venezuela, he refrained from naming the Trump administration and argued that upholding the rules-based order serves UK interests. He warned against flouting rules, defended Labour’s domestic rights record versus Reform UK’s agenda, championed the ECHR and mounted a robust defence of Keir Starmer’s leadership.",

Critics warn this reform‐or‐die approach may alienate progressive voters and still fall short of assuaging anti‐immigration sentiment.",

While Home Office insists on “strict legal safeguards”, dissidents warn Hong Kong authorities will exploit any pretext to pursue political targets. Exiled activists, including BNO passport holders, demand binding assurances against future politically motivated extraditions, citing past abuse of charges in Jimmy Lai’s trial. Critics link timing to UK-China trade talks and urge a dedicated appeal mechanism. UK courts, they say, cannot alone guard against hostile arrest warrants issued on UK soil.",

      "summary": "Western Australia’s Supreme Court has ordered David Sharaz to pay Linda Reynolds $92,000 in damages for defamatory tweets, and held him jointly liable with wife Brittany Higgins for a second tweet. Sharaz must also cover Reynolds’ indemnity costs, expected to top $500,000. The decision builds on an August ruling mandating Higgins pay $315,000 plus interest and 80% of legal fees (likely exceeding $1m), which she is appealing. Justice Tottle labeled the publications indefensible and said a settlement or apology should have preceded litigation.",

      "summary": "Baroness Brenda Hale, first female president of the UK Supreme Court, became a household name after ruling Boris Johnson’s parliamentary prorogation unlawful in 2019. Now retired, she has published With the Law on Our Side, a three-part book introducing readers to courts, citizens’ rights and law-making, while unflinchingly criticising chronic underfunding of criminal and family justice. Hale profiles cases from benefits tribunals to rape sentencing and single-sex spaces, exposing systemic cruelty, political pressures on sentencing tariffs and the tireless dedication of legal staff. Impartial and candid, she blends legal insight with wry humour to demystify courts.",
