      "summary": "The Bar Council urges that all family court cases involving domestic abuse be fully covered by legal aid for both parties, eliminating means tests for alleged victims. Its policy paper highlights that only 15% of families currently qualify, creating “legal advice deserts” and forcing litigants to self-represent. Recommendations include increased family law legal aid funding, national rollout of pathfinder and drug and alcohol courts, support for Domestic Abuse Protection Orders, and post-hearing perpetrator programmes. The council warns that underfunded, dilapidated courts compromise survivor-centred justice and hamper efforts to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.",

On appeal, the mother’s counsel argued such severe abuse cannot be dismissed as merely “historical” or irrelevant to child welfare. Garrido deemed the lower decision a “wrong turn” and ordered the hearing, stressing that proof of abuse is essential to assess the children’s risk. A report shows domestic abuse features in 87% of family cases but influences only 42% of rulings; advocates call for mandatory judicial training.",

      "summary": "Robert Jenrick will propose abolishing the independent Sentencing Council, transferring guideline-setting from judges to the lord chancellor and Ministry of Justice to enforce tougher sentences. Former Tory ministers including Dominic Grieve and Bob Neill denounce the plan as “bonkers,” unimplementable and dangerous, warning it would exacerbate prison overcrowding and risk system collapse. Established in 2010 to ensure consistent, expert-led sentencing, the council’s critics accuse it of watering down parliamentary intent on serious crimes. Labour MPs and legal experts call the move a politicisation of justice and a cynical gimmick.",

Over four decades he defended the Guardian, Mirror, Telegraph and Private Eye (with Ian Hislop), orchestrating wins in high-stakes trials—most notably quashing Noel Clarke’s £10m libel claim in 2023—and overturning BBC privacy injunctions for HarperCollins (Top Gear’s Ben Collins) and Andrew Marr. A partner at Davenport Lyons (1995–2014), later Gordon Dadds and Wiggin, he combined encyclopedic legal acumen with dry wit. Married to barrister Rupina Ahluwalia, he died after cancer treatment.",
