      "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that retirees whose sole income is the basic or new state pension will not face income tax on their payments, even when the new pension rises above the £12,570 personal allowance in 2027-28. Although the weekly rate will reach £241.30 (£12,547/year) in April 2026, threshold freezes would push it above the allowance by 2027, triggering small tax bills. The measure aims to reduce administration for those without private or additional state pensions but raises fairness concerns, with 2.5m on the old pension already taxed and private savers unprotected. No costings are yet provided.",

Debentures—transferable securities for Centre and No 1 Court seats plus hospitality—cost up to £116,000, fund facility maintenance and help keep general admission at £30 a day. Nearly 3,800 seats over 2026–30 are available via stockbroker or private sale, regulated by the FCA. The government’s crackdown targets for-profit reselling on platforms like Viagogo, but allows charity and debenture transfers.

Campaigners say women lost thousands when the state pension age rose from 60 to 65 and 66 amid DWP maladministration. A 2024 PHSO report urged payouts of £1,000–£2,950 per person (total £3.5–£10.5 billion), but ministers, led by Rachel Reeves and Liz Kendall, rejected it to protect public services. Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden will 'retake' the decision, though he cautioned it may still refuse redress.",

Now 47, Hu has held 19 jobs in 20 years—996 retail, 7pm–7am logistics (top 5,000 yuan), bakery apprentice, security guard, designer—reflecting China’s gig precarity and ≈300m migrant workers.

After a crash, their insurer provided three successive courtesy cars; the driver bought temporary courtesy permits for each, but short-notice vehicle swaps caused gaps between renewals. Driving into the zone twice daily, five days a week, triggered weekly PCNs, which continued during appeals. Despite the driver being on record as a Blue Badge permit holder, Newham initially rejected appeals. Following Guardian intervention, the council cancelled all PCNs and pledged to improve courtesy-permit processes.",
