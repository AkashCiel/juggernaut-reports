The 2021 England and Wales census shows private-renting households more than doubling in two decades to 5m (from 3.9m in 2011 and 1.9m in 2001). Older renters are surging: the National Housing Federation says 55+ PRS households rose 70% between 2010/11 and 2023. The call-out invites experiences, whether renting was expected, affordability, hopes of buying, and rental “horror stories.” Submit via form; terms of service and privacy policy apply.",

Rightmove says September year-on-year new buyer enquiries and new listings fell 5%; the usual post-summer bounce is absent, especially in southern England.

Allowances don’t roll over and vouchers aren’t accepted by all networks. Low-mileage users (<700 miles/month) expect higher bills; comparisons are harder because bundles are priced by miles, not kWh.

Ovo, serving 4m homes, denies financial motives despite Ofgem resilience shortfall; it pitches simplicity and waives exit fees.",
