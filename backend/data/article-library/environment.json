Europe, currently lacking rare earth mines, stakes €80 m on a Luleå demo plant and Norwegian REEtec tie-up to fast-track extraction and separation. Full mine-to-magnet chain may take 10–15 years, highlighting supply-chain hurdles for EU self-sufficiency. The effort aims to curb the EU’s reliance on China—which processes up to 100% of heavy rare earths—amid geopolitical tensions over supply “weaponisation.”",

While trading captive-bred birds is legal, smuggling wild chicks breaches UK law.

Based on nearly 1,000 labels, high-impact diets use prime cuts; low-impact ones rely on carcass by-products. Owners seeking to cut emissions should opt for non–grain-free dry foods, lower-prime-meat formulations or plant-based alternatives, and demand clearer labeling of ingredients.",

      "summary": "A University of Cambridge study led by Lisa-Maria Tanase reveals UK and Flemish MPs systematically underestimate public support for green measures—by 7–25 percentage points on policies from windfarms and solar subsidies to meat and frequent-flyer taxes and home efficiency grants. Surveys of 100 UK MPs and 600+ Belgian politicians, benchmarked against Ipsos and University of Antwerp polls, show misperceptions reduce MPs’ willingness to speak up or vote for climate action. Information interventions boost estimates but leave persistent gaps, implicating a rightwing-biased, vocal minority and disinformation in skewing perceived public opinion.",

Major flood warnings remain for the Flinders River, with moderate alerts on the Cloncurry and Western rivers. SES crews logged 34 flood-related calls and delivered supplies to stranded tourists near Cloncurry. Meanwhile, extreme fire danger prompts total bans in SA’s Mount Lofty Ranges and Eyre Peninsula, and active fires at Second Valley, Blanchetown and Meningie. Tropical Cyclone Hayley, packing 85 km/h winds and gusts to 120 km/h, is forecast to make landfall near the Dampier Peninsula by New Year’s Eve, bringing damaging winds, heavy rain and storm surge. Australia’s national temperature is now about 1.5 °C above 1910 levels, a trend intensifying extreme weather events.",

Analysis of blood samples reveals these mobile genome elements are upregulated in warmer, less icy habitats, suggesting rapid genetic adjustments—particularly in fat processing and energy pathways—to cope with scarce food and plant-rich diets. These findings, the first statistically robust link between climate warming and wild mammal DNA changes, offer insights into population vulnerability and guide conservation, but scientists caution bears remain threatened without urgent cuts in fossil fuel emissions.",

Using drone, acoustic and underwater footage plus suction-cup tags, scientists observed dolphins acting as “scouts,” echolocating to locate Chinook salmon and leading orcas to the schools. Orcas then herded, caught and broke apart fish at the surface while dolphins scavenged scraps without eliciting aggression. Alternating echolocation patterns suggest both species may eavesdrop, potentially expanding acoustic detection. The study highlights unexpected interspecies collaboration, raising questions about mutual benefits and the adaptive hunting strategies of these intelligent predators.",

      "summary": "A Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network study reports Caribbean hard-coral cover has declined 48% since 1980, halving reef habitat. Record marine heatwaves in 2023–24 drove a 16.9% annual loss by making symbiotic microalgae toxic and triggering bleaching, while cyclones break weakened coral. Macroalgae cover has risen 85% amid overfishing, replacing reef species that underpin $6.2 bn in fisheries and tourism. Yet resilient colonies discovered in the southern Gulf of Mexico spurred a new protected corridor. Researchers stress climate action and local measures—water-quality controls, protected areas and reduced tourism—to allow reef recovery.",

By striking the ground with a metal plate and analysing reflected waves, it detects compaction, moisture, microbial activity, organic matter and carbon levels without extensive digging. A free app will guide farmers to optimise water, organic inputs and tillage, boosting yields, reducing environmental impact and averting famine. Pilots in Kenya show reduced flood risk and fertility gaps. Experts say this affordable, low-disturbance method could transform global soil management.",

Spearheaded by Marshall Islands envoy Tina Stege and supported by Greenpeace, they challenged petrostates’ pushback after Cop28’s watered-down resolution. Brazil’s draft decision now includes an optional phase-out plan, but proponents like Vanuatu’s minister call for binding targets and measurable steps. The coalition stresses tailored transitions, financial and technology support for developing countries, and warns that Saudi Arabia, Russia and other veto-prone states could still block consensus.",

Aerial imagery from three beaches comparing 2022 and 2024 reveals dramatic declines that threaten the future stability of an island hosting 54% of the global breeding stock, as females take years to reach breeding age. Blocked tourist routes near Shackleton’s grave exposed the scale of die-offs. Researchers warn the virus remains active, spreading across bird and mammal species in the Antarctic, and call for urgent monitoring to gauge long-term ecosystem impacts.",

With global temperatures exceeding 1.5C, Stiell urged rapid methane cuts and a fossil-fuel phase-out to reverse warming. Delegates adopted a full agenda amid disputes over finance, emissions pledges and fossil-fuel transitions. Small island states and Brazil’s Lula pressed for a 1.5C roadmap, while wealthy and oil-exporting nations resist tighter targets.",

Over a third of Coalition voters deny future warming. Women exhibit a “gendered risk” calculus, and rising climate anxiety may depress Australia’s birthrate. Among parents, 60% of Labor vs 20% of Coalition voters worry about their children’s climate future; living through floods and fires had little lasting effect on concern.",

Surveying ten central Amazon lakes during the 2023–24 drought, researchers recorded record-breaking low-water levels, 75–90% surface loss, and warming rates of 0.3–0.8°C per decade, exceeding global averages. Experts warn repeated extreme heating will devastate aquatic biodiversity, disrupt breeding cycles and food webs, and urge systemic action on fossil fuel emissions to curb further warming.",

Beans fix soil nitrogen, need 5,000 litres of water per kg versus 15,400 for beef, cost 4.5 times less than meat alternatives, and are rich in fibre—only 4% of Britons get enough. The Food Foundation reports intake must increase sevenfold to meet Eat-Lancet standards. Retailers pledge 15%-50% sales boosts; more partners sought.",

EU sources say this regresses level-playing-field rules in the UK-EU trade deal, jeopardising trade and power market coupling by removing pre-build habitat safeguards and allowing Treasury claw-back of fund money. They warn energy market coupling could be imperilled, as the UK imports 16% of its electricity from the EU.

Raised kerbs, gravel surfaces, high or slanted touchscreens and heavy cables impede wheelchair users.

With 1.35 million disabled drivers—390,000 without home charging—and cuts looming to Motability, campaigners including EVA chief Vicky Edmonds and Motability’s Nigel Fletcher urge urgent publication and enforcement of revised standards.

Fengshen follows a series of deadly earthquakes in Cebu and Mindanao.

Beyond climate risks, facilities in hotspots such as Virginia and Texas consume billions of gallons of water for cooling and are driving up household bills by roughly 8% over five years. Growing voter opposition across parties suggests cost-of-living worries may be the decisive brake on expansion.",

With 60,000 local employees—80% Cumbrian—the plant fuels civic investment in digital hubs, river clean-ups and Pride sponsorship, and offers apprenticeships paying up to £30k. Yet many youths, like art-focused Cole McAvoy, report limited non-STEM pathways, underfunded creative classes and teacher turnover to better-paid nuclear roles. Local care-experienced and mental-health cases exceed national rates, compounded by unreliable transport. A new £20m government “Pride in Place” fund aims to broaden youth facilities, but residents warn reliance on a single industry risks marginalising diverse careers and leaving young people feeling there’s “Sellafield or nothing.”",

      "summary": "Colin Wyatt, a charismatic English naturalist, orchestrated a serial heist in 1946–47, stealing over 3,000 rare butterfly specimens from Australia’s state museums (Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide). Among them was the holotype of Pseudalmenus chlorinda barringtonensis (“flame hairstreak”), replaced with a thinly painted decoy. Most stolen specimens were repatriated in 1947, but the original holotype remained hidden in England until 2016, when ANU entomologist Michael Braby exposed the forgery. The scandal revealed deep vulnerabilities in museum collection protocols dependent on amateur access and highlighted the colonial legacies embedded in natural history archives.",

Eba detects floating faeces by scent, allowing remote collection of samples that reveal diet, hormones, toxins, microbiome, parasites and microplastics. Drones hover over surfacing whales to capture blow-hole plumes, yielding genetic, hormonal and thermal data. Facing Chinook salmon shortages, pollution and vessel noise, these methods minimise stress, support real-time interventions and inform efforts to protect genetically distinct orca populations integral to regional ecosystems and Indigenous cultures.",

Parallel Swiss data show a one-third decline since 1973. Researchers link declines to road traffic mortality, pond loss, urbanisation and prey shortages. The study underscores an accelerating collapse of British wildlife and calls for urgent, long-term monitoring and habitat protection across the UK and Europe to prevent further losses of this once-ubiquitous amphibian. Once celebrated in myths and literature, including The Wind in the Willows’ Mr Toad, the species now faces an uncertain future without coordinated action.",

Australian magpies warble solo as practice before loud group carolling for territorial cohesion, while noisy miners discern callers by pitch and rhythm when mobbing. Zebra finches model human speech and neurological research.",

Griffith University’s Dr Olaf Meynecke notes annual humpback entanglements are rising, affecting mostly mother–calf pairs as they migrate closeshore. Marine scientist Vanessa Pirotta warned calves risk drowning without rapid response amid debates over shark net removal.",

Local group Merchat, led by Charis Duthie and Caspar Lampkin, has secured £30,000 from Macphie and £40,000 from Aberdeenshire’s Coastal Communities Fund to install rock armour—£1,000 per truckload—to stabilise Beach Road and plug the gap in Scotland’s Great Trails map between Aberdeen and Dundee. With 100 homes at flood risk, they formed the Nescat charity amid minimal council support (£75k budget) despite £11.7m of national adaptation funding.",

About 50 late swallows gathered on wires at Corneale farm before migration. Maize growth promises winter fodder; farms remain self-sufficient in feed but buy straw bedding at £120/tonne. Domestic water relies on a century-old well as some boreholes run dry, worrying dairies and polytunnel growers. Hedges brim with ash and sycamore keys, red haws, acorns, scarlet honeysuckle and bryony berries. Oak leaves show mildew, ferns wilt; muddy ruts line lanes. A record apple and pear yield is earmarked for cider and perry, drawing orchard enthusiasts.",
