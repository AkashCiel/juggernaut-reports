She urges the government to act on Environmental Audit Committee and Institution of Civil Engineers recommendations: create a single national flood-reporting and information service, launch a public flood-awareness campaign, and enforce Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 to mandate sustainable drainage systems in all new developments. Without these coordinated, preventative measures, current reactive flood management leaves communities vulnerable.",

Under rules extended from one to three years, Nissan’s EU passenger-vehicle fleet will use BYD’s zero-emission credits. Similar pooling deals with Tesla and Polestar help legacy automakers average down combustion-engine output, though critics warn it may slow EV adoption and carmakers are lobbying to soften the EU’s 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel models amid infrastructure gaps in southern regions.",

Abundance was higher above woodlands, grasslands and urban areas but lower over intensive farmland and in brightly lit zones. Nocturnal declines, driven by light pollution and warming, suggest shifting distributions: northern species wane as climates warm, to be replaced by southerly taxa.

      "summary": "Joanna Macy, a Buddhist scholar and activist, championed a generational commitment to nuclear accountability. Rejecting the conventional “deep burial” approach that consigns radioactive waste to obscurity, she argued for perpetual visibility and active monitoring of nuclear byproducts. Through her writings and advocacy, Macy urged society to confront the long-term environmental and ethical ramifications of nuclear power and weapons, fostering intergenerational stewardship rather than relegating hazardous legacies to oblivion.",

Choerophyrne koeypad, a fingernail-sized climber with oversized toe pads and a metallic high-pitched tap, and Callulops gobakula, a larger boulder-dweller with a green tree frog-like croak, are both terrestrial breeders. Their closest relatives are in New Guinea’s central ranges; these endemics rely on deep boulder fields for thermal buffering. Findings published in Zootaxa.",

      "summary": "Conservationists in Seychelles have hatched 13 Aldabra giant tortoise hatchlings through a pioneering artificial incubation protocol developed with Nature Seychelles and University of Sheffield researcher Alessia Lavigne. Eggs were screened for fertilization after early embryo death affected 75% of undeveloped wild clutches, revealing environmental stressors, not genetics, as the main hatching barrier. The vulnerable species, once decimated by 19th-century hunting and protected on the UNESCO–listed Aldabra islands, now benefits from ex-situ support on Cousin Island amid emerging resort development threats. While artificial incubation offers short-term boosts, teams will prioritize improving natural nest conditions and sharing results with Galápagos scientists to aid broader tortoise conservation.",

Through these shifting geographies and practices, Saif explores migration, memory, belonging and the interplay between captivity and liberation.",

After contacting Jon Traill at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, the trust secured landowner support to rebuild the bund and restore the dew pond.

The restored pond mirrors the sky and valley, a quiet triumph of collaboration and landscape revival.",

      "summary": "An annual assessment by the Potsdam Institute finds global ocean acidity has crossed a critical pH threshold, marking the seventh of nine planetary boundaries to be transgressed. Since industrialization, surface pH has dropped ~0.1 units (30–40% acidity rise), endangering cold-water corals, reefs and Arctic ecosystems. Acidification reduces calcium carbonate availability, hurting shell-forming organisms and cascading up the food web, threatening fisheries, food security and the ocean’s heat absorption and carbon sequestration roles. Researchers call for immediate cuts in fossil fuel emissions, deforestation, pollution and stronger fisheries management to avert further planetary decline.",

Conservation groups hailed the ruling as precedent-setting, enforcing compliance with national environmental law and cutting through a backlog affecting over 575 species.

Staff report a push to do only the legal minimum, threatening the agency’s planning role. Though the EA officially denies receiving such orders, critics warn that clipping its independence—amid Rachel Reeves’s quango cull and proposed planning and water bills—could undermine nutrient neutrality rules, damage wildlife protections and yield poorly designed developments contrary to nature recovery goals.",
