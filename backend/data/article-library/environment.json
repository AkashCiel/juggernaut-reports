      "summary": "Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, urged chancellor Rachel Reeves to deliver an authentic Labour budget prioritising green investment, backing Energy Secretary Ed Miliband’s target of an 81% reduction in emissions by 2035. He argued the government must regain confidence by explaining net zero benefits—citing London’s ULEZ health gains—and funding green jobs such as heat-pump installers, electric-bus engineers and insulation specialists. Khan also pressed for Transport for London project funding and cohesive ministerial support at COP30. He criticised climate denial by global leaders, insisting the UK’s ‘special relationship’ demands candid climate leadership.",

In a two-year study of 75 three-to-five-year-olds across 10 urban nurseries, microbiome analyses (skin, saliva, faeces) and blood tests showed those in “green” centres had lower Streptococcus and Clostridium levels, increased regulatory T cells and improved immunity. These findings support the ‘old friends’ hypothesis that early contact with soil and plant microbes shapes the inner human microbiome, reducing allergy and autoimmune risks. Nordic kindergartens are now redesigning yards nationwide to harness these health benefits.",

Although largely non-migratory, their autumn restlessness, V-formation flights and rotating lead strategy for wind reduction remind her of the value of collective support, labour and rest. Their honking lifts her from daily chores, offering a poignant lesson on pacing oneself and finding resilience in interdependence as winter nears.",

Insurer concerns and conflicts between the sequential test and 1.5m-home plan expose misaligned policy.

They seek substantial damages and court-ordered remediation for biodiversity losses—otters, freshwater pearl mussels and Atlantic salmon—arguing regulators’ pledges and investments have failed. Defendants deny wrongdoing: Welsh Water cites limited infrastructure funding despite £70m spent on the Wye and £33m on the Usk, while poultry firms claim no direct manure spreading from their operations. Campaigners warn all UK rivers remain in poor biological and chemical health.",

UN climate summit rules and industry-led standards (ICVCM, offset ratings agencies) have barely improved quality; a Nature Communications study found under 16% of offsets deliver real cuts. The paper calls for phasing out non-removal offsets, redirecting markets to high-quality carbon dioxide removal/storage, adopting contribution-based funding, and salvaging select projects (cookstoves, landfill gas capture) with stricter protocols.",

With over half of habitable land used for farming—80% for livestock—experts warn that moderating meat intake, especially beef, could drastically reduce deforestation and emissions. They cite cultural sensitivity, industry lobbying and policy gridlock as barriers to comprehensive reporting.",

E3G’s Kaysie Brown says it misaligns with China’s decarbonisation goals, while others cite Beijing’s ‘underpromise and overdeliver’ record. Critics warn weak near-term ambition and new coal approvals undercut leadership claims, though China’s $625bn clean-energy investments, steep renewables cost cuts and EV surge could sway markets ahead of COP30.",

      "summary": "At St Dominic in the Tamar Valley, early autumn rains have greened cut hay and silage fields and softened stubble after an unusually early cereal harvest. About 50 late swallows gathered on wires at Corneale farm before migration. Maize growth promises winter fodder; farms remain self-sufficient in feed but buy straw bedding at £120/tonne. Domestic water relies on a century-old well as some boreholes run dry, worrying dairies and polytunnel growers. Hedges brim with ash and sycamore keys, red haws, acorns, scarlet honeysuckle and bryony berries. Oak leaves show mildew, ferns wilt; muddy ruts line lanes. A record apple and pear yield is earmarked for cider and perry, drawing orchard enthusiasts.",

      "trailText": "Labor’s new goal for 2035 is for emissions to be 62% to 70% lower than in 2005. It’s less ambitious than the UK’s target but higher than in Japan, Canada and NZ",
      "summary": "Australia’s new 2035 climate target commits to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 62–70% below 2005 levels, up from its previous 47% by 2030 goal. This mid-century milestone sits below the UK’s 78% cut but above Japan’s 59%, Canada’s 45–50% and New Zealand’s 51–55%, while the EU eyes the high-60s to low-70s range. It forms part of Australia’s 2050 net-zero pledge and aligns with Paris Agreement aims to limit warming under 2°C. Experts hail it as a historic choice, balancing environmental duty, economic transition to renewables and global collective effort to tackle climate impacts.",
