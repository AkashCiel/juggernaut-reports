    "description": "I’m deeply engaged in AI alignment and existential risks, driven by concern that advanced AI could drift from its intended goals. I track safety research breakthroughs—methods, benchmarks, protocols—lab experiments revealing misalignment, policy and regulatory updates, and real-world incident reports to spot warning signs early, following sources like the AI 2027 blog. I’m also interested in quantum computing’s practical and scientific applications and understanding its broader societal, economic, and ethical impacts.",
