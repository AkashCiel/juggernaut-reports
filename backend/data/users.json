    "description": "I’m deeply engaged in AI alignment and existential risks from misaligned AI, and regularly track AI safety research—new methods, benchmarks, protocols—and real-world experiments or reports of risky model behavior to spot warning signs early. I follow sources like the AI 2027 blog and similar content to stay updated on prevention efforts and potential red flags. I’m also interested in quantum computing’s practical and scientific applications and in understanding its broader societal, economic, and ethical impacts.",
