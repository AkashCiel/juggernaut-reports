    "description": "I’m deeply engaged in AI alignment and existential risks, concerned that advanced models might drift from their intended goals, so I monitor safety research breakthroughs—methods, benchmarks, and protocols—empirical experiments that reveal misalignment, policy and regulatory updates, and documented failures or accidents across sources like the AI 2027 blog and Guardian reporting to spot early warning signals. I’m also interested in quantum computing’s practical and scientific applications and their broader societal, economic, and ethical impacts.",
