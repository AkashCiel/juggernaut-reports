                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs) designed to address two systemic shortcomings in todays open model ecosystem: data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data, retroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on 15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks, rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites, and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.

                GenExam: A Multidisciplinary Text-to-Image Exam

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models ability to integrate knowledge, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

                Defending Diffusion Models Against Membership Inference Attacks via Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.

                Language models activations linearly encode training-order recency

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We show that language models activations linearly encode when information was learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known training order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but otherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average activations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training order: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly in the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that linear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish early vs. late entities, generalizing to entities unseen during the probes own training. The model can also be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entitys training stage (~80% accuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to simple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our paper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by its acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might manage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.

                A Universal Banach--Bregman Framework for Stochastic Iterations: Unifying Stochastic Mirror Descent, Learning and LLM Training
                
                    <strong>Authors:</strong> Johnny R. Zhang, Xiaomei Mi, Gaoyuan Du, Qianyi Sun, Shiqi Wang, Jiaxuan Li, Wenhua Zhou
                
                
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial intelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, natural gradient descent in information geometry, or Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations, establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization. It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations ($\lambda  2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks), deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning (actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.

                Dense Video Understanding with Gated Residual Tokenization
                
                    <strong>Authors:</strong> Haichao Zhang, Wenhao Chai, Shwai He, Ang Li, Yun Fu
                
                
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.

                Hierarchical Learning for Maze Navigation: Emergence of Mental Representations via Second-Order Learning
                
                    <strong>Authors:</strong> Shalima Binta Manir, Tim Oates
                
                
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Mental representation, characterized by structured internal models mirroring external environments, is fundamental to advanced cognition but remains challenging to investigate empirically. Existing theory hypothesizes that second-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning (i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such environment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this hypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a second-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions of optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCNs parameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We demonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the cognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the environment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant performance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks, providing empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental representations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning.

                AI and the Future of Academic Peer Review

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Peer review remains the central quality-control mechanism of science, yet its ability to fulfill this role is increasingly strained. Empirical studies document serious shortcomings: long publication delays, escalating reviewer burden concentrated on a small minority of scholars, inconsistent quality and low inter-reviewer agreement, and systematic biases by gender, language, and institutional prestige. Decades of human-centered reforms have yielded only marginal improvements. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), is being piloted across the peer-review pipeline by journals, funders, and individual reviewers. Early studies suggest that AI assistance can produce reviews comparable in quality to humans, accelerate reviewer selection and feedback, and reduce certain biases, but also raise distinctive concerns about hallucination, confidentiality, gaming, novelty recognition, and loss of trust. In this paper, we map the aims and persistent failure modes of peer review to specific LLM applications and systematically analyze the objections they raise alongside safeguards that could make their use acceptable. Drawing on emerging evidence, we show that targeted, supervised LLM assistance can plausibly improve error detection, timeliness, and reviewer workload without displacing human judgment. We highlight advanced architectures, including fine-tuned, retrieval-augmented, and multi-agent systems, that may enable more reliable, auditable, and interdisciplinary review. We argue that ethical and practical considerations are not peripheral but constitutive: the legitimacy of AI-assisted peer review depends on governance choices as much as technical capacity. The path forward is neither uncritical adoption nor reflexive rejection, but carefully scoped pilots with explicit evaluation metrics, transparency, and accountability.

                Index Date Imputation For Survival Outcomes for Externally Controlled Trials
                
                    <strong>Authors:</strong> Q. Le Coent, G. L. Rosner, M-C. Wang, C. Hu
                
                
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Externally controlled trials (ECTs) compare outcomes between a single-arm trial and external controls drawn from sources such as historical trials, registries, or observational studies. In survival analysis, a major challenge arises when the time origin (index date) differs across groups, for example, when treatment initiation occurs after a delay in the single-arm trial but is undefined in the external controls. This misalignment can bias treatment effect estimates and distort causal interpretation. We propose a novel statistical method, Index Date Imputation (IDI), that imputes comparable index dates for external control patients using the estimated distribution of treatment initiation times from the single-arm cohort. To address population-level confounding, IDI is combined with propensity score weighting or matching, yielding balanced and temporally aligned cohorts for survival comparison. We detail diagnostics for covariate balance and truncation bias, and evaluate performance via extensive simulations. Applying IDI to a randomized oncology trial, we demonstrate that the method recovers the known treatment effect despite artificial index date misalignment. IDI provides a principled framework for time-to-event analyses in ECTs and is broadly applicable in oncology and rare disease settings.

                Bridging Past and Future: Distribution-Aware Alignment for Time Series Forecasting
                
                    <strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Hu, Jie Yang, Tian Zhou, Peiyuan Liu, Yujin Tang, Rong Jin, Liang Sun
                
                
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Representation learning techniques like contrastive learning have long been explored in time series forecasting, mirroring their success in computer vision and natural language processing. Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep learning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign.
